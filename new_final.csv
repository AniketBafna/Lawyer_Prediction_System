9253,81,8,147,29,2991,the term serious hardship is not defined in the act in powell v evreniades 1989 21 fcr 252 evreniades hill j considered the term as used in s 265 of the income tax assessment act 1936 cth his honour who was concerned with serious hardship to a taxpayers dependants upon the death of the taxpayer observed at 258 there is no definition in s 265 of what is meant by serious hardship nor would one expect there to be each of the words in the phrase is an ordinary english word having a well understood meaning the context in which the words appear makes it clear that the relief board is to consider whether the exaction of the full amount of tax would involve the dependants of a deceased taxpayer in financial difficulty which in all the circumstances can be said to be serious the financial difficulty will be such that the dependants will be in significant need warranting action by the relief board to relieve their condition 14 hill j accepted that there was a distinction between extreme and serious hardship noting that what will constitute either will depend on the circumstances his honour also said it was inappropriate to attempt to state tests of what would constitute serious hardship in the abstract and commented at 259 clearly there would be severe financial hardship if the dependants of a deceased person were left destitute without any means of support that is not to say that in any particular case something less than that will not constitute serious hardship these observations were referred to with apparent approval by gummow j in van grieken v veilands 1991 21 atr 1639 at 1644 16 in the amended notice of appeal the applicant complains that the tribunal used the wrong test in determining the prospect of serious hardship for the respondent in its written submissions it expressed its complaint somewhat differently saying that the tribunal misunderstood the meaning of the term it seems to me that the latter expression is less likely to lead to confusion as it recognises at least implicitly that serious hardship is itself the test that has to be applied to an applicants circumstances to decide if that applicant is eligible for relief from a tax debt there is no other test although there may be issues about which factors in the particular circumstances are or are not relevant to this determination it is because the assessment is based so squarely on the individual circumstances that hill j in evreniades thought it was inappropriate to try and identify in the abstract the circumstances that would give rise to serious hardship 17 this is not to say that guidance cannot be given by examples in which the test of serious hardship would clearly be met in evreniades hill j gave such an example when he recognised that there would be severe financial hardship if persons were left destitute without any means of support the taxation ruling gives a similar example when it says that there would be serious hardship if a taxpayer were left without the means to achieve reasonable acquisitions of food clothing medical supplies accommodation education for children and other basic requirements i do not see any inconsistency in these examples effect must be given to the qualification of reasonable in the taxation ruling and consistently with the reasoning of hill j these examples do not exclude the possibility that something less than destitution will constitute serious hardship whether this is so depends on the particular circumstances of each case 18 it is not entirely clear that the tribunal appreciated that the taxation ruling allowed for consideration of individual circumstances in commenting on the ruling the tribunal said that it is no more than policy and cannot bind this tribunal this comment seems to suggest that the tribunal misunderstood the ruling as providing a rigid rule as i have already explained i do not think that this is the correct interpretation of the ruling but as the tribunal did not apply any such rigid rule the misunderstanding is not of present concern 19 the applicant submitted that the tribunals rejection of the taxation ruling indicates that it used some other unidentified test of serious hardship to make its decision i do not accept this submission the tribunal noted that what is needed for proper maintenance and support is a relative question that can only be answered with regard to the whole of the taxpayers circumstances the tribunal considered all the relevant aspects of the respondents circumstances including whether he could achieve acquisitions of food clothing medical supplies accommodation education for children and other basic requirements that were not excessive or unreasonable in all the circumstances i do not accept that the tribunal used the wrong test 59 the tribunal was aware that it had discretion to grant or withhold relief even it was satisfied on the serious hardship point this is made clear by the tribunals quoting from the decision of hill j in evreniades where his honour said at 262263 it follows from trebilco that in the course of consideration of the release of tax under s 265 the board may consider not only such matters as go to the issue of serious hardship but also other matters which in the discretion of the board may be relevant those other matters being merely proscribed by the general principle that the discretion must be exercised bona fide and for the purposes for which it was conferred there being jurisdiction in this court to intervene if in the overall exercise of the discretion the board does take into account considerations which having regard to the purposes served by s 265 can be seen to be irrelevant 60 i am satisfied that the tribunal did exercise its discretion although the issue of discretion is not addressed under a separate heading there is sufficient indication of this throughout the tribunals reasons for me to be satisfied that this is so 61 it was accepted on all sides that the respondents debt had not arisen because of avoidance or participation in any scheme the applicant submitted however that the tribunal failed to take into account that the respondent had earned substantial amounts of money in the relevant period without making adequate provision for his tax liability the transcript of the hearing before the tribunal shows that the tribunal questioned the respondent about the issue the respondent talked at length about the difficulties he had in the law firm where the income that gave rise to the tax debt was generated he said that the firm had the capacity to reduce his income retrospectively so that amounts that he was anticipating he would receive did not materialise he also referred to difficulties he had experienced on a family level in moving from interstate at a time when his wifes illness with consequent medical expenses first manifested itself at the same time one childs learning difficulty and anothers serious heart condition now resolved were diagnosed the combination of these factors led to his neglecting his financial affairs and not realising that a debt was accumulated his subsequent drop in income made it impossible to meet the debt

1675,82,24,290,16,46090,commonwealth v northern land council 1993 hca 24 1993 176 clr 604 a public interest immunity case about documents recording cabinet deliberations the court said at 620 there was therefore no call for jenkinson j to order that the documents be produced for inspection but we would add that even if there had been the procedure of ordering production of documents for inspection by the legal representatives of one of the parties even upon a restricted basis before the claim for immunity had been decided by the court was open to serious question whatever the safeguards it represents an encroachment upon the confidentiality claimed for the documents and in this case public interest in their immunity from disclosure was of the highest order if inspection of documents is necessary to determine the question of immunity and in this case it was not then it ought to be carried out by the court before ordering production for inspection by a party no doubt this may in some cases cast a heavy burden on the court but it is unavoidable if confidentiality is to be maintained until a claim for immunity is determined see also alister v the queen 1984 154 clr 404

over which privilege was claimed in gypsy jokers crennan j spoke more broadly of information in documents certain material relied on for determination of a proceeding and confidential material before a court which was not revealed to a party seeking it in the queen v bebic unreported 27 may 1982 the court of criminal appeal of new south wales dealt specifically with the disclosure of the contents of an affidavit tendered in support of a public interest immunity claim there samuels ja nagle cj at cl and cantor j said at 4 mr mason tendered an affidavit in support of his claim for privilege he submitted however that the affidavit should not be placed on the file that is to say that it should be read only by the court and not disclosed to the party calling on the footing that the contents of the affidavit would or might themselves compromise the claims for privilege we had and still have some doubts about the propriety of restricting the affidavit in the way proposed however it may well be that that course is in certain cases of which this is one no more than a logical extension of the established practice of the courts inspecting the allegedly privileged documents itself later at 5 after saying that the court had read both documents in question and the affidavit in support of the claim for privilege their honours said it seems to us that granted that it is now commonplace for judges to make a private inspection of documents in order to resolve a claim for privilege it follows that in a proper case the judge may similarly keep to himself the affidavit by which the claim is supported the court then ordered that the affidavit remain sealed up with the papers on the ground that to disclose its contents might prejudice the claim for privilege i have referred in connection with the respondents affidavit to the great importance that is attached to the respondents opinion as to the damage to national security incident upon disclosure obviously that is also the case in relation to the disclosure of the documents over which privilege is claimed i have summarised the respondents reasons for his opinion about the possible effects of disclosure of the documents in question this is all derived from the open parts of his affidavit the final appreciations and related briefing notes set out the reasoning process that underlies the making of security assessments which are the key mechanism by which asio advises government that particular individuals pose a threat to national security if documents falling within this class were required to be produced asio would be giving information about its knowledge assessments and methodology to the very people to whom it is most important that national security information is not disclosed cf alister 154 clr at 454455 per brennan j as the respondent has deposed the relevant class is one of the classes of documents held by asio that require the greatest level of protection first because of the inherent sensitivity of the information that is routinely contained in such documents and second because of the detrimental consequences in terms of the quality of decisionmaking that would be likely to follow if asio officers were forced to omit particular kinds of information from final appreciations and related briefing notes due to the risk that those documents will become available to persons the subject of security assessments the applicants contended that the respondent was not able to make a class claim it was said that he seeks to describe as a class claim documents which he considers constitutes a final appreciation and documents related thereto that description they say does not constitute an identifiable class the table in the affidavit set out at 9 refers to an internal email an internal minute and a briefing note it does not refer to any final appreciation by way of contrast the applicants assert that cabinet documents constitute a clear class claim here they say the socalled class claim involves the respondent asserting for himself that particular documents constitute final appreciations i do not think that is a fair description of the respondents claim the presently relevant parts of his affidavit are as follows a shortly after identifying the documents in the table at 9 he describes them on a class basis as paradigm examples of documents that asio should not be required to disclose save in exceptional circumstances b the results of complex security assessments are usually contained in a final appreciation document though it may not be headed in that way c the final appreciation ordinarily takes the form of an asio minute d when the investigative branch assesses an individual to be a threat to australias national security the respondent is advised usually by a dgbn e often both a dgbn and a final appreciation are provided to the respondent for decision f it is the document on which a security assessment is based being the final appreciation however that document is headed and any associated dgbn that cannot be disclosed g the class claim advanced concerns the class of documents shortly described as final appreciation documents and related briefing notes h documents in this class invariably contain specific detail as to why persons are assessed as a risk to national security and specific details of intelligence sources and methods i the respondent has examined the asio documents namely those in the table the class claim and the contents claim documents and j the disclosure of the documents in i would prejudice australias national security for the reasons stated in the affidavit

21862,91,10,318,113,45972,the high court dawson mchugh and gummow jj with brennan cj and kirby j dissenting in applicant a v minister for immigration and ethnic affairs 1997 hca 4 1997 190 clr 225 applicant a held that such fear would not constitute persecution for a convention reason 24 in applicant a the tribunal had accepted as a matter of fact that coercive measures were used in the implementation of chinas family planning policy and that coercive measures ranged from forms of civil discrimination to fines and forced contraception sterilisation and abortion see at 251 the tribunal defined the social group in question as those who having only one child do not accept the limitations placed on them or who are coerced or forced into being sterilised 25 the majority in the high court held that persons who oppose chinas one child policy and feared sterilisation did not constitute a particular social group because the uniting feature was a fear of persecution 26 dawson j said in his reasons at 243 in this case the reason the appellants fear persecution is not that they belong to any group since there is no evidence that being the parents of one child and not accepting the limitations imposed by government policy is a characteristic which because it is shared with others unites a collection of persons and sets them apart from society at large it is not an accurate response to say that the government itself perceives such persons to be a group and persecutes individuals because they belong to it rather the persecution is carried out in the enforcement of a policy which applies generally the persecution feared by the appellants is a result of the fact that by their actions they have brought themselves within its terms the only recognisable group to which they can sensibly be said to belong is the group comprising those who fear persecution pursuant to the one child policy for the reasons i have given that cannot be regarded as a particular social group for the purposes of the convention 27 mchugh j said at 269270 if as is probably the case the tribunal meant by those who do not accept the limitations placed on them those couples who believe that they should be able to have more than one child notwithstanding the governments policy there is nothing to link the couples so as to create a perception that they constitute a particular social group there is simply a disparate collection of couples throughout china who want to have more than one child contrary to the one child policy some may wish to have a child as soon as possible some in the near future and others in the distant future there is no social attribute or characteristic linking the couples nothing external that would allow them to be perceived as a particular social group for convention purposes to classify such couples as a particular social group is to create an artificial construct that bears no resemblance to a social group as that term is ordinarily understood 28 and gummow j said at 285 i would assume for the purposes of the determination of this appeal that the prc has a one child policy infringement of which attracts as a matter of governmental decision the sanctions feared by the appellants i assume therefore that there exists a policy which is being implemented in a fashion which engulfs a number of persons for whom the prc is their country of nationality on that footing a disparate collection of parents and those desiring to be parents who do not accept and have difficulties in complying with a one child policy are at risk of the application of a general law of conduct required by the state and on the assumptions i have made brutally enforced but they are not members of a particular social group with a fear of persecution by reason of membership thereof 29 the only distinguishing feature between applicant a and the present case is the form of persecution feared namely the appellant in the present case fears compulsory abortion as opposed to compulsory sterilisation 30 gummow j said at 286 that the form the persecution takes should not be inserted into the definition of the social group 31 consistent with the judgment of the high court in applicant a the tribunal while accepting that the applicant has been badly persecuted in the past concluded that the appellant had not pointed to any harm which would amount to persecution which she fears she will suffer for one or more of the five convention reasons if she returns to china 32 similarly before the federal magistrates court scarlett fm records in 29 of his honours reasons counsel for the minister ms sirtes submitted that the applicant whilst she had made quite clear that she did not wish to return to china had not demonstrated any jurisdictional error on the part of the tribunal and submitted that the applicants unfortunate circumstances did not provide any ground for remitting her application to the tribunal 33 scarlett fm held that ground 2 of the appellants appeal was really a challenge to the tribunals factual findings and therefore no case of jurisdictional error on the part of the tribunal had been made out 34 this is not a challenge to a factual finding by the tribunal the tribunal held however that mistreatment amounting to persecution for breach of the one child policy was not persecution because of membership of a particular social group and therefore the appellant did not fall within the definition of a refugee 35 the legal position is plain the appeal to this court from the federal magistrates court has to be dismissed with costs

to be loss or damage for which monetary damages could be awarded that may well be correct but demagogue may be distinguished on the basis that it concerned misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the trade practices act 1974 cth the trade practices act in the form of nondisclosure by a vendor of unusual features relating to access to land located at noosa heads in the state of queensland which the purchasers who sought relief under s 871 andor 1a of the trade practices act acquired by entering into a contract which they would never have entered into had they been aware of the true position with regard to access to the site the trial judge had clearly found a causal link between the misleading and deceptive conduct and the purchasers entry into the contract see per black cj at 33 and per gummow j at 42 112 each of black cj gummow j and cooper j found that the expression loss or damage where used in s 87 of the trade practices act and which corresponded in many respects with s 4122 of the act in the present case could include being saddled with an agreement which had been induced by misleading or deceptive conduct at 33 black cj said i consider it to be clear that the loss or damage contemplated by s 871a is not limited to loss or damage in the s 82 monetary damages sense but was intended to include the detriment suffered by being bound to a contract unconscionably induced in my view the loss or damage for the purposes of both ss 871 and 871a will include the detriment suffered by being bound to a contract induced by misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 proof of loss or damage of the sort that would be an amount of loss or damage for the purpose of s 82 is not a prerequisite for the grant of relief under either subsection 113 gummow j in his leading judgment said at 4243 the phrase loss or damage appears in s 82 and in various subsections of s 87 particularly subss 1 and 1a in my view on this appeal nothing turns upon the circumstance that in a given case subs 1 may be attracted only by reason of the making of an application under s 82 to recover the amount of the loss or damage suffered by conduct in contravention in sic a provision of pt iv or v section 82 is concerned with the recovery of the amount of the loss or damage suffered by conduct in contravention of the act section 871 requires that the court consider that its order will compensate in whole or in part for the loss or damage or will prevent or reduce the loss or damage section 871a requires that the orders concerned will compensate in whole or in part for the loss or damage suffered or likely to be suffered or will prevent or reduce the loss or damage suffered or likely to be suffered thus whilst s 82 is concerned with the recovery of an amount representing the loss or damage s 87 is concerned with compensation whether in whole or in part for loss or damage and with the reduction of loss or damage and with the prevention of loss or damage which is likely to be suffered in the phrase likely to be suffered the word likely speaks of a real chance or possibility western australia v wardley australia ltd 1991 30 fcr 245 at 261 one significant distinction between ss 82 and 87 is the quia timet operation of s 87 on the appeal to the high court in wardley australia ltd v western australia 1992 hca 55 1992 175 clr 514 at 527 mason cj dawson gaudron and mchugh jj said the act draws a clear distinction in pt vi between loss or damage which may be recovered under s 82 and the likelihood of loss or damage which may be prevented or if not prevented reduced by one of the remedies under s 87 deane j said at 850 that the statute in s 87 expressly distinguishes between the actual suffering of loss or damage and the likelihood or contingency that loss or damage will be suffered in the future this emphasises that the phrase the loss or damage at least in s 87 may be concerned with more than pecuniary recovery as understood in the law of damages in tort tort law postulates the commission already accomplished of a wrong leeds industrial cooperative society ltd v slack 1924 ac 851 at 859 868869 further unlike the position at general law with the administration of the equitable remedy of rescission of contracts orders under s 87 may be made not only against parties to the contract but also against third parties being persons involved within the meaning of s 75b in the contravention as a result of which the plaintiff entered into the contract lezam pty ltd v seabridge australia pty ltd at 304 munchies management pty ltd v belperio at 714 the respondents complain that they entered into a contract as the result of reliance upon conduct which contravened s 52 why should they not be described as having suffered loss or damage within the meaning of s 87 by that very reliance and entry into legal relations from which they otherwise would have abstained if that contract be declared void ab initio as provided for in s 872a will that not reduce this loss or damage 114 cooper j also proceeded in demagogue to expound upon the meaning of the phrase loss or damage at 44 gummow j expressed his agreement with what cooper j said in that regard cooper js observations were recorded at 4648 as follows section 87 provides both the source of the courts power to provide a remedy and the remedy itself it is therefore important to distinguish clearly between the need to establish the factual circumstances necessary to enliven the power of the court to grant relief and the circumstances which are relevant to the nature of the relief which it is appropriate to grant the circumstance in s 871 which empowers the court to grant relief is a finding that a party has suffered or is likely to suffer loss or damage by the conduct of another person that is a question of fact the words loss or damage where they appear in s 871 are to be construed by the application of the ordinary canons of statutory construction this requires giving the words their ordinary meaning in the context in which they appear the ordinary meaning of loss is detriment or disadvantage resulting from deprivation or change of conditions shorter oxford english dictionary 3rd ed revised 1990 at 1241 damage is defined as 1 loss or detriment caused by hurt or injury affecting estate condition or circumstances arch 2 injury harm shorter oxford english dictionary at 485 there are two matters within the context of s 871 which colour the meaning of the phrase in the section the first is that the loss or damage has been or is likely to be caused by conduct in contravention of the act the second is that any order made is to compensate for the loss or damage however the compensation is not limited to the payment of a money sum or damages as an examination of s 872 discloses nor is there anything in s 872 which would limit the loss or damage suffered or likely to be suffered to pecuniary loss or damage in particular s 872a declaring a contract or collateral agreement to be void and s 872ba refusing to enforce any or all provisions of a contract take as their point of focus the denial of the benefit of a contract to a person whose proscribed conduct has caused loss or damage to the other party such an order has the consequential effect of releasing the innocent party from the obligations imposed by the contract in the context of providing compensation it is the obligations imposed by such a contract which is the loss or damage which the order seeks to redress in my opinion loss or damage in s 871 means no more than the disadvantage which is suffered by a person as the result of the act or default of another halsburys laws of england 4th ed vol 12 par 1102 in the circumstances provided for in the section the phrase loss or damage in s 871 does not involve any concept of quantum or assessment of damages see barneys blucrete pty ltd v australian workers union 1979 43 flr 463 at 473 where northrop j expressed a similar view as to the use of the same phrase in s 45d1a of the act this is to be contrasted with the context of the phrase in s 82 where it is the amount of the loss or damage which is recoverable by action for the purpose of s 82 it is the quantum or assessment of the loss or damage suffered in monetary terms which must be demonstrated the rules as to the assessment of damages or the measure of damages in an action for deceit are relevant to the question of loss or damage under s 82 however those rules are not relevant to the meaning of the phrase in s 871 the distinction between loss or damage and the amount of the loss or damage is reflected in the terms of section 4k of the act the section provides in this act a a reference to loss or damage other than a reference to the amount of any loss or damage includes a reference to injury and b a reference to the amount of any loss or damage includes a reference to damages in respect of an injury there are practical reasons why this should be so the prima facie rule that the measure of damage in deceit is the difference between the value of the property and the price paid is inappropriate where the contract is not completed myers v transpacific pastoral co pty ltd 1986 atpr 47421 at 47424 where the contract remains unrescinded the costs associated with the conveyance of the property are costs arising out of the contract and of performing the obligations imposed thereby until the contract is rescinded such costs and expenses do not take on the character of costs and expenses thrown away and as such recoverable loss and damage under the general law the court is not restricted in granting a remedy under s 87 by the limitations under the general law of a partys right to rescind for breach of contract or misrepresentation henjo investments pty ltd v collins marrickville pty ltd 1988 79 alr 83 at 102 109 likewise the limitations under the general law as to the assessment of damages and the measure of damage ought not be imported into a definition of loss or damage in s 87 to limit the category of actionable loss or damage to adopt a definition of loss or damage for the purpose of s 871 which includes the disadvantage of incurring contractual obligations that would not have been incurred but for the conduct complained of does not mean that the granting of a proper discretionary remedy necessarily leads to the setting aside of such a contract or to a refusal to enforce it according to its terms that result will always depend upon the particular circumstances which exist when the occasion calls for an exercise of the powers under s 87 of the act 115 the problem for the applicant and ms stringer in particular in the present case is that there is simply no evidence of any loss or damage for which monetary damages could be awarded if otherwise appropriate and available in her favour or in favour of any of karellas other employees nor is there any evidence that the approval making andor coming into operation of the 2007 agreement resulted from the contravention by karellas of s 3411 of the act 116 section 4122 of the act confines the courts power to declare a workplace agreement void to those cases where the relevant loss or damage to be remedied prevented or reduced is loss or damage resulting from the relevant contravention in order to establish a causal link between the contravention of s 3411 of the act and karellas employees becoming saddled with the 2007 agreement in this case evidence would be required from employees of karellas who voted to approve the agreement indicating that had it not been for one or other of the misrepresentations contained in the four page document or the three page document put around by karellas they would not have voted as they did 117 in the absence of any evidence on the issue the court may not make an order declaring the 2007 agreement void it is unnecessary in the circumstances to address the proper exercise of the courts discretion to grant relief under s 409a of the act were it otherwise able to do so 118 in the foregoing circumstances there should be a declaration that the employee collective

12335,20,12,83,39,34986,to the question posed in 56b above the cause of action based upon the breach of the equitable duty of confidence the following matters are relevant a the classic definition of the equitable duty of confidence is found in lord ashburton v pape 1913 2 ch 469 at 475 at that part of his reasons swinfen eady lj said the principle upon which the court of chancery has acted for many years has been to restrain the publication of confidential information improperly or surreptitiously obtained or of information imparted in confidence which ought not to be divulged injunctions have been granted to give effectual relief that is not only to restrain the disclosure of confidential information but to prevent copies being made of any record of that information and if copies have already been made to restrain them from being further copied and to restrain persons into whose possession that confidential information has come from themselves in turn divulging or propagating it these observations were cited with evident approval by mason j in commonwealth v john fairfax amp sons ltd 1980 hca 44 1980 147 clr 39 at 50 b in the present case the information was not improperly or surreptitiously obtained it is contended that it was imparted in confidence in circumstances where it ought not to be divulged c the question of whether an equitable duty arises in the present case is not straightforward the relevant information was contained in documents which were produced pursuant to compulsory powers invoked by the accc and in circumstances where it is at least arguable that the only source of any duty of confidence is s 155aaa itself although the use of documents and information obtained compulsorily in this way is constrained by s 155aaa and perhaps may be constrained by other general law principles it is difficult to see how a party in the position of allphones could sensibly expect that the information would be kept confidential and not disclosed even for legitimate purposes associated with the due performance by the accc of its statutory functions it may be thought that this is particularly so in circumstances where allphones made no express claim for confidentiality when the documents were produced in cadbury schweppes pty ltd v amcor limited 2008 fca 88 2008 246 alr 137 2008 atpr 42218 gordon j in the context of considering claims that documents ought not to be disclosed on public interest immunity grounds said at 30 the theoretical merit of the acccs confidentiality contentions is even more deficient a cartel claim by definition involves collusion between two or more actors in the same way that it is both inevitable and selfevident that the statements of a cooperating criminal conspirator will be used against ie disclosed to the noncooperating conspirators it must be taken for granted that a cartel participant contemplating a confession to the authorities knows or should know that his statements will be used by the authorities to prosecute the other party or parties as such the acccs claim that a party like amcor can have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality with respect to statements made to investigators is devoid of substance and without such a reasonable expectation the acccs contention that nondisclosure of the documents is required to protect the public interest cannot stand and d the definition of protected information seems to me to contemplate a dichotomy between information that is given voluntarily in confidence to the accc on the one hand and information that was obtained by the accc compulsorily pursuant to a s 155 notice on the other hand in the latter case the section seems to contemplate that there is no room for any equitable duty of confidence to arise

9577,63,26,21,2,21497,the contention of the applicant in the present case that the court could debar the respondents from defending the proceeding and strike out their defences is based on a comment of lord donaldson of lymington mr in derby amp co ltd v weldon nos 3 and 4 1990 1 ch 65 at 81 in that case the english court of appeal was considering whether it was appropriate for a court to grant a mareva type injunction in respect of assets beyond the jurisdiction of the court relevant to that question was the question whether such an injunction could be enforced in any event the master of the rolls said in the context of the grant of the mareva injunction i think that a sufficient sanction exists in the fact that in the event of disobedience the court could bar the defendants right to defend this is not a consequence which it could contemplate lightly as it would become a fugitive from a final judgment given against it without its explanations having been heard and which might well be enforced against it by other courts neill lj at 87 and butlersloss lj at 96 expressed agreement with the judgment of the master of the rolls each went on to deal with the issues in the case with neill lj at 95 expressing specific agreement with what the master of the rolls had said about enforceability butlersloss lj did not comment specifically on that issue it is unnecessary in the present case to debate the question whether barring the right to defend a proceeding falls within the range of penalties the court could impose for contempt of court order 35a of the federal court rules contains specific provisions about the powers of the court in the event of default of a party in complying with an order order 35a r 22d provides that a respondent is in default by failing to comply with an order of the court in a proceeding order 35a r 32c provides that if a respondent is in default the court may if the proceeding was commenced by an application supported by a statement of claim or the court has ordered that the proceeding continue on pleadings give judgment against the respondent for the relief that i the applicant appears entitled to on the statement of claim and ii the court is satisfied it has power to grant order 35a r 32d also provides that if a respondent is in default the court may give judgment or make any other order against the respondent order 35a r 4 specifically provides that o 35a does not limit the power of the court to punish for contempt it must be the case however that if the court exercises its power to give judgment against a respondent on the ground that the respondent has failed to comply with an order of the court and the giving of judgment has significant consequences for the respondent those consequences could be taken into account as factors mitigating the exercise of the courts powers to punish for contempt 52 the contempt in this case is a serious one it involved a significant sum of money 73 98757 as i have said ms bell was well aware that an injunction had been granted restricting her freedom of action in relation to the sale of the mariners place property and her freedom of action to deal with the proceeds of sale if a sale were effected she chose not to have regard to the terms of that order she preferred to satisfy her obligations or perceived obligations and to spend the money for her own purposes instead of complying with the injunction in short she preferred her own interests and even her own whims to her duty to comply with the injunction the effect of the contempt on the administration of justice is also of major significance if ms bell had complied with the injunction the applicant would have been secure in the knowledge that he could bring the proceeding to its conclusion and if he were to be successful there would be a substantial asset available to satisfy the judgment and to augment the estate of the bankrupt for the benefit of the bankrupts creditors there is now a powerful disincentive to the applicant in proceeding to a conclusion because the execution of any judgment is much less likely to prove fruitful this consequence can be ameliorated to some extent by exercising the power to give judgment summarily against ms bell thereby saving the applicant from the need to expend further costs in the proceeding but it still renders the proceeding largely fruitless for the applicant if as appears to be the case ms bell has no means of satisfying a judgment the effect of the contempt therefore is to tilt the balance in the litigation heavily against the applicant 53 there can be little doubt that a contempt of this magnitude coupled with the degree of culpability of ms bell amounting to wilful blindness as to the terms of the order as i have said and to preferring to satisfy her own needs and desires would warrant a significant term of imprisonment only if there are powerful mitigating factors would it be appropriate to consider a course other than imprisonment as a minimum step it is therefore necessary to turn to the mitigating factors 54 ms bell claims that she did not understand the nature of the order and therefore that she did not intend to commit a breach of it or to demonstrate any disrespect for the court she has expressed her contrition for her failure to comply and has apologised to the court i accept that she did not in fact understand the terms of the order although they had been explained to her by her then counsel and she was in possession of a copy of the order although i do not consider that the order is a particularly complex one i can accept that legal terminology and drafting techniques can make an order less than wholly comprehensible to some people 55 the fact is however as i have found that ms bell did not pay any heed to the order at all she did not take the trouble to read it in the context of the conduct of the auction of the mariners place property or in the context of her disposal of the proceeds of sale she did not provide the agent responsible for the sale or the auctioneer with the copy of the order that she had either for the purpose of guiding their conduct or for the purpose of seeking guidance from them as to her own she did not seek advice from kelly amp chapman who were then acting for her in the principal proceeding she simply decided not to have regard to the order even when her contravention of it was pointed out to her she took no immediate steps to remedy the contravention her initial explanation in her affidavit of 21 september 2006 was anything but frank as to what had happened to the proceeds it was necessary for me to make a further order on 25 september 2006 requiring ms bell to make an affidavit explaining specifically the manner in which the sum of 73 98757 had been expended even then in her affidavit of 9 october 2006 she was vague about a number of the payments she had made both of these affidavits were prepared by her without legal assistance which is a partial explanation for their inadequacy even when she swore her affidavit of 18 december 2006 prepared with the assistance of her pro bono lawyers no further detail was provided only in her oral evidence and under crossexamination was further detail about the payments obtained her expression of contrition and her formal apology to the court only came about after she had received the advice of her counsel as to the seriousness of her position

intended them to have 47 in ascertaining what meaning the differing expressions in ss 2902c and 3121e were taken by the parliament to have it is important to bear in mind that each section is concerned with the impact which a conviction may have upon the authoritys performance of its functions in relation to the registration of a migration agent first s 2902c appears in the principal provision dealing with the function of registration which is an annual event for every migration agent secondly s 3121e is relevant to the ongoing function of the authority under s 303 pursuant to which it has a discretion to cancel or suspend the registration of a migration agent or to caution him or her the occasion for the exercise of that discretion arises if the authority is satisfied inter alia that 303 f the agent is not a person of integrity or is otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance 48 the evident purpose of s 312 is to cast an obligation on the migration agent to notify the authority of the events there enumerated so that the authority can consider whether to revisit pursuant to s 303 and the scheme of natural justice in part 3 of division 3 of the act the question of registration thus under s 3121a the migration agents bankruptcy must be notified and s 303e makes bankruptcy a matter which enlivens the authoritys powers to cancel or suspend the migration agents registration or to caution him or her and s 2902g requires the authority to take into account an applicants bankruptcy at any time in considering whether to register him or her as a migration agent 49 additionally s 3121 deals with events which occur after registration but which had they occurred beforehand would have been relevant for the authoritys consideration in deciding whether to register the person as a migration agent however it is important in construing these provisions to consider the fact that a contravention of s 3121 is an offence of strict liability s 3122 while s 290 creates no offence 59 gleeson cj and gummow j 200 clr at 397 25 held that the term law of the commonwealth in s 80 of the constitution refers to laws made under

addressed to armstrong scalisi holdings pty ltd the applicants contended that a notice could not be addressed to a corporation but only to its proper officer in truth there were two submissions here one a submission that a notice could not be served upon a corporation the other that if it was it had to be addressed to the corporations proper officer these arguments are so it seems to me quite without substance it has been accepted that a corporation cannot be required physically to attend and give evidence for the very good reason that it is an abstraction lacking physical form smorgon v australian and new zealand banking group 1976 hca 53 1976 134 clr 475 at 481482 per stephen j however that physical constraint has no impact on the ability of a corporation to answer questions it is for that reason well established that a corporation may be required to provide information indeed lockhart j described the contrary argument as fallacious in fieldhouse v commissioner of taxation 1989 25 fcr 187 at 198 an observation with which i respectfully agree burchett and hill jj also rejected the argument at 203 and 218 respectively the power in reg 1682 to require production of books and documents is a power to produce books and documents in the custody of the person receiving the notice it does not extend to require a party to bring documents into existence fieldhouse at 194195 per lockhart j 204 per burchett j and 209 per hill j it follows that the notice could not lawfully require the production by cap of copies of original documents held by it of course it is possible that the notice did not on its proper construction seek the creation of documents but instead the production of any copy documents which were in fact held lockhart j canvassed this possibility in fieldhouse at 194195 in this case i do not think that the natural and ordinary meaning of subparagraphs a c d and g is that they require production of copies already in existence it follows that these paragraphs are not supported by reg 1682 even if that were not so however the subparagraphs are ambiguous in that they leave the recipient unsure whether production of copies already existing is called for or whether copies of originals are to be made the notice is therefore also bad for uncertainty cf commissioner of taxation v australian and new zealand banking group ltd 1979 143 clr 499 at 525 per gibbs cj fieldhouse at 193 per lockhart j 204 per burchett j and 210 per hill j failure to specify matter it has been held that a notice under s 264 which is bad in part may be severed so much was held by burchett j in fieldhouse at 204 and by hill j at 210 lockhart j clearly assumed such a power to exist however on the facts in fieldhouse both lockhart and burchett jj thought that severance was not practical because the provision of the copies was central to the notice so that parts of it no longer made sense if the paragraphs dealing with copies were excised hill j on the other hand did not share this concern i do not think that the notice in this case suffers from that problem paragraphs a c d and g can be severed from the notice without the balance of it losing coherence it should be noted in passing that the form of reg 1682 may well present difficulties of application in the case of electronically held records but it is not presently necessary to address the issues thereby arising interference with course of criminal jurisdiction sam also challenged the notice on the general ground of its capacity to interfere with the criminal proceedings facing him it is i think important to bring out into the open a suppressed premise upon which that argument rested it was that the notice presently requires cap to do something in fact the time for compliance with the notice expired on 9 february 2009 and it is no longer capable of being complied with there is presently no legal obligation upon cap to provide the information sought in the notice it would not be possible to obtain a court order to compel cap to provide the information in a real sense the notice is spent the possible relevance of the notice seems therefore only to be twofold a although it is no longer capable of being complied with the noncompliance may have been a criminal offence if the information which was originally required by the notice were now volunteered by cap it might be relevant to any penalty which was imposed upon it a related concern i would think is the capacity of the continuing failure to provide the information to constitute professional misconduct voluntary production may well be likely reduce the seriousness of these matters the board itself made this point in its letter of 6 march 2009 which in terms said as the board has not withdrawn its notice to give evidence to the board dated 16 january 2009 you are required to comply failure to do so may result in prosecution under regulation 168 of the income tax assessment act 1936 any conviction may reflect poorly on your good fame integrity character and fitness and propriety b it is possible that cap may be prosecuted for a failure to comply with the notice despite these rather indirect incentives to provide the information to the board there was no evidence before me that cap was proposing now to do so davids evidence on this issue was i wanted the notice issue determined as i do not want to be prosecuted for failure to comply i do not want to be issued with further notices that i believe are beyond what the board is entitled to serve sam gave no evidence on this issue at all there is therefore no evidence that cap is intending voluntarily to produce the information previously sought in the notice it is not the case that cap is under a present obligation to provide the information sought in that circumstance the notice appears to present no real risk to the conduct of the criminal proceedings against sam absent a real risk to the administration of justice in those proceedings the notice should not be set aside on the basis that it constitutes a contempt blf at 56 per gibbs cj conclusion

18363,46,28,46,28,37831,caltex submitted that the residual oils were at no time delivered for home consumption because the concept of delivery in the excise act signifies a transfer of actual or constructive possession from one person to another in this case it said there was no such transfer because it used the residual oils itself at its own premises caltex relied on a passage from oconnor js judgment in r v lyon 1906 hca 17 1906 3 clr 770 lyon where his honour in the context of the customs legislation dealt with the provision for customs control over goods until delivery for home consumption or exportation which provision is mirrored in s 61 of the excise act his honour stated at 784 the object of that provision if it were necessary to give any reasons for its enactment is obvious if once goods go into home consumption that is into circulation it becomes almost impossible to trace them 136 according to caltex goods such as the residual oils which never leave its premises cannot be said to go into circulation and cannot therefore have been delivered for home consumption 139 the commissioners submissions can be summarised as follows a upon their manufacture caltex did not sell or export the residual oils it dedicated them for its own use as refinery fuel at the relevant premises its dedication of the oils for that use is plain on the evidence which demonstrates that caltex maintained and consumed the oils for that purpose b the expression delivered for home consumption ss 61 and 61c is broad and should not be read down as applying only to delivery of goods between individuals or between places nor should home consumption be limited by reference to the identity of the actual consumer ie whether the consumer is a third party or the manufacturer him or herself c the concept of delivery for home consumption is critical to s 611 because it determines the period of the commissioners control over excisable goods in s 611 the concept exists to distinguish between two places for consumption australia home or overseas export the use of the preposition for in the phrases delivered for home consumption and delivered for exportation demonstrate the section is concerned more broadly with the place of consumption rather than the transfer of possession between parties d the phrase go into circulation used by oconnor j in lyon 1906 hca 17 3 clr 770 was intended to explain the concept of home consumption not delivered for home consumption that much is clear from the context in which his honour used the phrase being an explanation of the customs authorities control over goods as a form of security until payment of the required duty here caltexs premises are in australia and consumption of the residual oils within those premises is sufficient for the oils to go into circulation e the residual oils were delivered for home consumption in a manner provided for by the excise act they were delivered pursuant to caltexs permissions under s 61c and that delivery gave rise to a deemed entry for home consumption see s 61c2 accordingly caltex was required as a condition of its permission to include the residual oils in its weekly return and pay the corresponding duty 141 another way of considering this is by reference to s 61 section 61 renders all excisable goods subject to the commissioners control until delivered for home consumption or for exportation to a place outside australia whichever occurs first the control residing with the commissioner is of broad scope and is critical for the protection of the commonwealths excise revenue see lyon 1906 hca 17 3 clr 770 and collector of customs new south wales v southern shipping co ltd 1962 hca 20 1962 107 clr 279 southern shipping the section contemplates that excisable goods will be delivered for either home consumption or exportation in my view the section evinces a legislative intention to cover the field in respect of all forms of internal home consumption and all exports historically excise duties have been understood as running together with and supplementary to the customs duties traditionally imposed on certain goods in philip morris ltd v commissioner of business franchises victoria 1989 hca 38 1989 167 clr 399 at 427 mason cj and deane j approved the following passage from quick and garrans annotated constitution of the australian commonwealth 1901 the fundamental conception of the term excise is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country in the taxation of such articles of luxury as spirits beer tobacco and cigars it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the importation of these articles and a corresponding or reduced duty on similar articles produced or manufactured in the country and this is the sense in which excise duties have been understood in the australian colonies and in which the expression was intended to be used in the constitution of the commonwealth 143 contrary to caltexs submissions i do not accept that the reference in lyon 1906 hca 17 3 clr 770 to goods going into circulation necessitates a more restricted construction of delivered for home consumption justice oconnors reference to going into circulation was used to explain how effective security over goods is lost once they have entered home consumption his honour was not there describing the concept of delivery nor more importantly intending to limit its scope he was drawing attention to the policy of the customs legislation and the importance of the customs authorities having a form of security over imported goods to ensure the payment of duty i agree with the commissioner that caltexs dedication of the residual oils for consumption by it at its premises is sufficient in the sense oconnor j had in mind for the oils to go into circulation 144 similarly i reject caltexs submission that the words from a place in s 61c mean that excisable goods must be removed from that place before they can be considered delivered for home consumption again while caltexs construction accords with what will occur in the typical case the section is not limited to that situation the section also accommodates and is consistent with a delivery for home consumption constituted by a use of the relevant goods at that place furthermore the reference to a place in s 61c seems to me to be more concerned with the manner in which the commissioners control can be effectively exercised section 61c follows ss 61 61a and 61b each of which concern itself with the commissioners control and the granting of permissions in the case of s 61c it seems to me that it is a necessary or at least convenient measure in permitting deliveries into home consumption without formal entries that such activity is authorised only in respect of certain specified premises at which the commissioners control and supervision can be effectively exercised 145 for these reasons i consider that caltex delivered the residual oils for home consumption pursuant to its s 61c permissions accordingly if i am wrong on the refined point then caltex was obliged to account for the residual oils in its weekly returns and is liable to pay the requisite duty on them 154 in relation to b caltexs submission has the effect that s 60 could only operate where excisable goods have not in fact been delivered for home consumption the commissioner submitted that s 60 applies whether or not goods have been delivered for home consumption he emphasised that the purpose of the commissioners control over excisable goods is to ensure that duty is properly paid relying on lyon 1906 hca 17 3 clr 770 and southern shipping 1962 hca 20 107 clr 279 and the obligations imposed by s 60 are designed to ensure that the goods do not find their way into home consumption without proper payment relying on sidebottom 2000 fca 607 98 fcr 579 more particularly the commissioner said that s 60 is aimed directly at the unauthorised relinquishment of possession which would include delivering goods for home consumption in a manner that was not authorised principally where there is no payment of duty

17662,13,18,215,69,37018,her honour found that the respondent controlled the adelaide institute and thereby was responsible for its actions and for the material which was published on the adelaide institutes websites she found that the material contained in the ai document conveyed the imputations which were the subject matters of the orders mentioned above she found that publishing material on a website which is not password protected had the effect of communicating that information to the public such publication allows persons who access the website with a browser to view the material her honour described how the material moves through the world wide web by relying on the description given in the canadian human rights tribunal in citron v zuumlndel no 4 2002 41 chrr d74 at 60 the internet is a means of global communication that relies on a universal set of protocols or standards for the transmission of information two related sets of communication instructions transmission control protocol tcp and internet protocol ip govern how information will move through the system defining addresses routing systems and all the regulation necessary to permit communication among users her honour also relied on the tribunals description of the world wide web at 67 the world wide web the web is a specific application that uses the internet to send and display data including text graphics audio and video there are two active components on the web a server that stores and transmits information and a client or browser that requests receives and displays the information obtained from the server a web site is a collection of computer files that are coded in a specific way to allow information to be sent on request to a browser the files are then displayed in a way consistent with the instructions provided by the creator of the web site every web site has a unique uniform resource locator url akin to their internet address once connected to the internet the url is necessary to gain access to a given web site her honour found that publication of the ai document on the world wide web amounted to conduct which was rendered unlawful by the racial discrimination act and made a declaration accordingly her honour found that the ai document and other material published by the respondent on the world wide web conveyed the imputations in paragraph 2 of the september 2002 orders her honour found that the first and second imputations would engender feelings of hurt and pain within members of the jewish community who would by reason of the publication consider themselves being treated contemptuously disrespectfully and offensively she also found that the third and fourth imputations would offend insult hurt and wound members of the jewish community and engender the same senses the judge found that the publication of the ai document was unlawful under s 18c of the racial discrimination act and that it was published because of the ethnic origin of the people in the group identified in the document namely jews and it was an act reasonably likely to humiliate and intimidate jewish people the judge found that the respondent had not established any exceptions under s 18d of the racial discrimination act her honour made a permanent injunction restraining the respondent first from publishing to the public on the world wide web the ai document or any document with substantially similar content to that document and secondly from publishing any material which would convey the imputations which she had previously found to be unlawful the respondents reaction the respondent appealed against the september 2002 orders the respondent deleted all material on the website within the time prescribed by paragraph 1 of her honours orders that action indicates an awareness of the september 2002 orders however some time before 23 september 2002 the material which was contained in the ai document was again published on the same website on 14 december 2002 the respondent attended the 3 rd international historical revisionism conference in italy and published further material on the website on 5 february 2003 the respondent entered the september 2002 orders initially the respondent argued that the sealed order now on file did not reflect her honours reasons but that argument was abandoned the respondents appeal on 22 april 2003 the respondent filed an amended notice of appeal against the september 2002 orders the notice of appeal did not challenge the finding made by branson j that publication of the material was conduct which was rendered unlawful by s 18c of the racial discrimination act being conduct which was reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend insult humiliate and intimidate the groups or persons identified by her honour three matters were argued on the appeal first that part iia of the racial discrimination act was unconstitutional secondly the material which had been published on the website did not have a sufficient degree of causal connection with race colour or national or ethnic origin as required by s 18c of the racial discrimination act thirdly the published material fell within the exemption to the provisions of part iia in s 18d in may 2003 at or about the time the matter was heard by the full court the respondent published on the website that the appeal would signal how strong the jewish zionist influence is in australias judiciary where a battle rages between common law and talmudic law the full court dismissed the respondents challenge to the validity of part iia of the racial discrimination act carr and kiefel jj found that the provisions of part iia were supported by the external affairs power allsop j found that part iia ss 18c and 18c 1b in its statutory context are reasonably capable of being considered as appropriate and adopted to implement the obligations assumed by australia under the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination done at new york on 7 march 1966 the full court found that the ai document was calculated to offend in itself those who maintain that the holocaust occurred and in particular jewish people it concluded at least one reason the ai document was published was because of the race or ethnic origin of jewish australians it found that the ai document was deliberately provocative and inflammatory and contrived to smear jews it rejected the respondents contention that he was entitled to an exemption by reason of s 18db which provides that s 18c does not render unlawful anything said or done reasonably and in good faith in the course of any publication made for genuine academic or other genuine purpose in the public interest i disagree the intention of the september 2002 orders is to prevent dr toben from continuing to engage in conduct that is rendered unlawful by s 18c of the racial discrimination act the september 2002 orders were designed to achieve that result in two ways first in paragraph 2 by requiring dr toben to remove from the adelaide institute website the ai document and any other material which conveyed the imputations in paragraph 2aiii branson j made that clear when she approved at 111 the approach taken by the canadian human rights tribunal which considered the utility of making any order in a similar case in the case of citron v zuumlndel 41 chrr d74 the tribunal said at 300 any remedy awarded by this or any tribunal will inevitably serve a number of purposes prevention and elimination of discriminatory practises is only one of the outcomes flowing from an order issued as a consequence of these proceedings there is also a significant symbolic value in the public denunciation of the actions that are the subject of this complaint similarly there is the potential educative and ultimately larger preventative benefit that can be achieved by open discussion of the principles enunciated in this or any tribunal decision paragraph 3 of the orders was designed to ensure that once there had been compliance with paragraph 2 of the orders conduct of the kind which gave rise to the declaration in paragraph 1 would not be repeated to that end paragraph 3 restrains dr toben from publishing the ai document anywhere on the world wide web and further restrains him from publishing material with substantially similar content to that document it was necessary to include paragraph 3b because otherwise it might have been said by dr toben that he was entitled to publish on the world wide web information which was in slightly different form to that which was contained in the ai document paragraph 3c of the orders is designed to reflect insofar as future conduct is concerned that which dr toben was obliged to remove from the world wide web website in accordance with paragraph 2aiii in my opinion the orders are not imprecise or vague and uncertain they do not become so because they require the party to whom they are directed to make a subjective assessment of the material which may be published on the world wide web

research amp development pty ltd v commonwealth as french j observed in olbers co ltd v commonwealth of australia no 3 2003 fca 651 at 8 the overarching consideration informing the discretion to make an order under o 29 r 2 is efficient case management the institute made the following submissions in support of its motion 1 the conduct complained of by david jones was not on the institutes part conduct in trade or commerce for various reasons including that the media release and the further media release were not made for any business purposes of the institute or dr hamilton but for the public benefit and to engender participate in and foster public debate with the ultimate aim of as suggested in the discussion paper instigating improvements to the regulatory system for marketing and advertising of this kind 2 an answer favourable to the institute on the issue of whether its conduct is in trade or commerce would be a complete answer to david jones case and 3 the evidence on the threshold issue of whether the conduct of the institute complained of is in trade or commerce is discrete and totally or almost totally quarantined from the merits issues whether the conduct was misleading or deceptive and whether there was any contravention of the tpa in furtherance of the submission in 163 above the institute submitted that the expert evidence in this case is entirely limited to the merits issues whether or not the conduct engaged in was misleading or deceptive and that apart from some accounting evidence there is no expert evidence that could be called or would be helpful to the issue of whether the institute or dr hamilton engaged in trade or commerce this is why the submission went there is the potential for such an enormous cost saving and saving of court time because the contravention issues involve a very wide range of expert evidence the nature of which is outlined in ex 2 it was submitted on behalf of the institute that if there was an issue of credit it might go to for example the sort of business the institute is engaged in and the extent to which the discussion papers were published for a commercial purpose such credit issues would not be significant they are not expected to overlap with the same issue on the merits part of the case it is not expected that the same lay witnesses who would be called on the question of the business activities of the institute would also be giving evidence about the nature of the advertising or the nature of the conduct engaged in by david jones finally the institute submitted that if there was a separate issue ordered and decided the fact that it might generate an appeal was not a relevant factor as to the possibility that the resolution of the question posed in a particular way would dispose of the proceedings or significantly shorten them with an attendant saving in time and money one is reminded of what french j said in olbers at 31 any prophesied economies are to be balanced against the fragmentation of the trial of the issue experience in the courts over many years has demonstrated that fragmentation of proceedings rarely result in any saving of time in the long run and that projections as to costs savings are likely at best to be speculative

many decisions since including recently re coles group limited 2007 vsc 389 per robson j 30 there may be some difference of opinion or perhaps only of emphasis between the views of robson j in re coles group ltd 2007 vsc 389 and fryberg j in re mincom ltd 2007 61 acsr 266 as to whether it is necessary to consider s 41117 at the first stage of the two stage process for the court to direct the meeting and then after the scheme is voted upon to approve it if that consideration is relevant at this point that is whether there is a likelihood or prospect of s 41117 being satisfied at first stage i have the necessary level of satisfaction at this point and on the material referred to the provisional view of asic referred to above indicates that there is a prospect of it producing to the court the form of statement referred to in s 41117b although of course the court then clearly is not obliged to approve the proposed scheme alternatively on the information presently available to me as i have indicated i do not see a reason why if the members of hostworks at the proposed meeting of the scheme support the proposed scheme i would not be satisfied that the scheme has not been proposed for the purpose of enabling any person to avoid the operation of any of the provisions of chapter 6 that must necessarily be only a tentative and provisional judgment however it is accepted as is now commonplace that in circumstances such as the present an entity such as hostworks has a choice between following the takeover procedure in chapter 6 in conjunction with broadcast australia or following the scheme of arrangement procedure supported by inter partes documentary agreements as contemplated by pt 51 of chapter 5 of the act consequently the mere choice of the procedure now being adopted is not an indication that a purpose of this procedure is to enable any person to avoid the operation of any provisions of chapter 6 there will thus need to be some identification of which provision or provisions of chapter 6 might relevantly operate so as to produce potentially a different outcome to that which would follow from the present procedure and an exploration of why the pt 51 procedure has been used having regard to that provision or those provisions if s 41117a is to be enlivened such consideration may also be relevant to the discretion of the court under s 41117 if asic has provided a statement under s 41117b no such provision has presently been identified 32 the performance risk concern has been raised in previous scheme of arrangement applications they are referred to by lindgren j in re apn news 62 acsr 400 at 23 i will not repeat them it is necessary to consider the so called performance risk of shareholders being left in a position once the scheme has become effective of their shares having been transferred to broadcast australia but then facing a delay in the provision of the scheme consideration so that their only remedy would be to sue on the deed poll that risk has been overcome here by requiring the scheme consideration to be paid to hostworks before 12 noon on the implementation date to be held in trust by hostworks for the purpose of being paid to the scheme participants that is the shareholders of hostworks before they are divested of their shares in hostworks later on in the implementation date broadcast australia must provide the funds to pay for the shares it is to acquire before they are transferred a similar arrangement was satisfactory to robson j for the purposes of authorising or directing the calling of the proposed meeting in re coles group 2007 vsc 389 see at 38 the deed poll contains a covenant on the part of broadcast australia to provide the scheme consideration on the implementation date in accordance with the terms of the scheme so that it ties the settlement step of payment and transfer together 41 under cl 73a of the implementation agreement each scheme participant is deemed to have warranted that all of its shares in hostworks which are transferred under the scheme will be free from all mortgages and encumbrances fryberg j in re mincom ltd no 3 2007 25 aclc 207 regarded an

adopt the views of lindgren j i share the understanding of his honour that the purpose and effect of such a clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged the amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty would be equal to the amount required to discharge the encumbrance i note that the approach of

22639,99,18,371,204,9462,mr geller examined the decision of the court of appeals for the second circuit in itartass russian news agency v russian kurier inc 1998 usca2 315 153 f3d 82 1998 he treated it as authority for the proposition that copyright ownership issues are governed by the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the property at issue and the parties claiming ownership 45 mr geller noted that itartass has been applied by the district court for the central district of california western division lahiri v universal music amp video distribution inc 513 supp 2d 1172 2007 47 mr geller has appended to his report copies of title 17 the cases referred to above and others i have read the cases i need refer only to itartass itself the case concerned a copyright newspaper article and had nothing to do with films the court first noted that title 17 contains no provision concerning conflicts issues it was necessary therefore to fill the interstices of the act by developing federal common law on the conflicts issue the court said conflicts rule for issues of ownership copyright is a form of property and the usual rule is that the interests of the parties in property are determined by the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the property and the parties the restatement recognises the applicability of this principle to intangibles such as a literary idea the court then applied that rule to the facts of the case which as the respondents pointed out were much more related to russia than are the facts of the present case related to australia but that is neither here nor there it is the choice of law rule that matters not the outcome of its application in itartass 48 the respondents relied on the evidence of mr reichman who has undoubted expertise in copyright law he disagrees with mr gellers opinion and believes there is a strong possibility that the us court will apply us copyright law to determine copyright ownership of the secret he gives his reasons 53 the second related deficiency in mr gellers report concerns itartass he records the essential reasoning of the court in that case but does not advert to the note appended to the following statement to whatever extent we look to the berne convention itself as guidance in the development of federal common law on the conflicts issue we find nothing to alter our conclusion the convention does not purport to settle issues of ownership with one exception not relevant to this case the note n 12 reads in part the berne convention expressly provides that ownership of copyright in a cinematographic work shall be a matter for legislation in the country where protection is claimed art 14bis2a the note goes on to explore whether the article contains any implication as to the choice of law for copyright issues other than ownership as indicated at 46 itartass did not concern a cinematographic work 54 one of the attachments to mr gellers report is his article in journal copyright society of the united states of america 2004 conflict of laws in copyright cases infringement and ownership issues at 326 mr geller says to repeat our basic point if a field such as copyright has a treatygoverned international system an ordre public international such as the bernetrips regime then the principles of that system to the extent relevant to choice of law must serve as binding constraints on conflicts analysis in the field in terms of the second restatement of conflict of laws reading treaty commitments into the first criterion of section 62a the needs of the international system help to meet other criteria of section 6 because it is anchored in treaty principles this approach enhances the certainty predictability and uniformity of results the restatement framework sets up two levels of conflicts analysis we have already indicated that at a first level section 62a of the restatement sets out a number of criteria for generally resolving conflicts of law the first being the needs of the international system the second level of analysis of the restatement is found in provisions regarding special areas of law for example in section 222 regarding the choice of laws to govern copyright ownership issues in such instances the restatement proposes to choose the local law of the jurisdiction which with respect to the issue in question has the most significant relationship to the ultimate facts of the case but this relationship is to be determined under the principles stated in italics added section 6 thus in resolving conflicts of laws in crossborder cases under the restatement us courts are directed to attend to any relevant international system at the first level of analysis in order to guide focusing on any arguable significant relationship adumbrated at the second level of analysis following the restatement analysis in crossborder copyright cases the courts should then take account of the relevant system that is the bernetrips regime which the united states has implemented in the copyright act although mr geller does not refer to art 14bis2a that passage provides additional support for attending to the provisions of the berne convention in any search by a united states court for the appropriate choice of law in a copyright ownership case 55 art 14bis2a directs one to the law of the country where protection is claimed that is the law of the united states title 17 provides in s 104b that the works specified in s 102 which include motion pictures are subject to protection under this title if the work is first published in the united states as the works in question here were 68 c ts productions registration under title 17 is a clear invocation of the protection of the us copyright regime the effect of that invocation is that under art 52 of the berne convention claims in the united states are governed by us law d drew pictures has also sought to avail itself of the protection of us copyright law e the film and the screenplay were first published in the united states accordingly that country is their country of origin under art 54 of the convention f title 17 grants copyright protection to joint authors of cinematograph films if mr heriot makes out his case as a coauthor of the screenplay and a director of the film he is entitled to copyright protection in the us and it is irrelevant whether the works were conceived in australia or partly made here g article 14bis2a of the convention allows the us to legislate for ownership of copyright in a cinematograph film and us law makes provision for joint ownership in films which counsel submitted the act does not appear to do h mr reichmans expert evidence should be preferred to that of mr geller mr gellers reliance on itartass is misplaced here the works were first published in the united states that is their country of origin further itartass observed that although the berne convention does not purport to settle all questions of copyright ownership art 14bis2a does deal with ownership of copyright in cinematic films this very case i australian law will apply in the proceeding in this court title 17 will apply to the illinois proceeding there is no identity of issues because the two statutory regimes are different on that basis there can be no antisuit injunction to stop the respondents prosecuting their claim in the illinois proceeding j us domestic law will apply to infringement in the illinois proceeding itartass k where initial infringement occurs in the united states and subsequent infringement occurs elsewhere united states law allows the recovery of damages for external infringement at least if there is a causal link between the infringements sheldon v metrogoldwyn pictures corporation 106 f2d 45 1939 that is not the position in australia s 1011 of the act thus a cross claim for infringement in this proceeding would only cover damages for infringement in australia l joint authors of films are not known to australian law and that is the central claim in the complaint the declarations sought in the illinois proceeding that the works are joint works that the respondents can exploit the works independently of ts production and that mr heriot is a coauthor of the works are not available under australian law it is common ground that amendment of the united states copyright register can only be ordered by a united states court m the provisions of the act relied on namely ss 224 and 98 are quite different from the coownership provisions in title 17 on which the respondents rely in the illinois proceeding 74 for the reasons i have given at 49 to 55 the us court will apply united states law to the ownership dispute if the plaintiffs establish ownership in drew pictures infringement and damages or lost profits will also be governed by united states law itartass

4345,38,6,286,72,5981,it is necessary because of the jurisdictional issue raised by the commission to set out the questions of law and the grounds of appeal contained in mr masliczeks notice of appeal they are 2 questions of law raised in the appeal 11 was the tribunal wrong in law in the methodology it adopted to ascertain whether the applicant was entitled to have the claimed condition of post traumatic stress disorder ptsd accepted as a war related disease 12 was the tribunal wrong in law by applying incorrectly or not at all sections 119 120 1 and 3 120a of the veterans entitlements act 1986 cth and the decision of deledio v repatriation commission this is a reference to the decision of the full court in repatriation commission v deledio 1998 fca 391 1998 83 fcr 82 in which at 9798 the court explained a four step process to be followed by the tribunal in determining whether the applicant has established a link between his or her operational service and a medical condition which is relied on to support the payment of a pension 13 was the tribunal wrong in law in determining the diagnosis of the condition of post traumatic stress disorder ptsd by reference to the statements of principle alone without regard to the expert clinical medical evidence of the psychiatrists who had interviewed the applicant 14 was the tribunal wrong in law in failing to apply or to apply correctly all relevant statements of principle for ptsd 15 was the tribunal wrong in law in failing to give adequate and proper consideration to the applicants claim for the condition of osteoarthrosis of the fingers of the right hand in its determination that the right ear hearing problem was covered by the accepted disability of hearing loss of the left ear 16 was the tribunal wrong in law by applying mines v repatriation commission which contradicted the high court decisions of bushell v repatriation commission byrnes v repatriation commission and repatriation commission v obrian and the full federal court decisions of repatriation commission v whetton and deledio and repatriation commission 17 was the tribunal wrong in law by failing to provide adequate and sufficient reasons for its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based 3 grounds of appeal 31 the tribunal was wrong in law in the methodology it adopted in ascertaining whether the applicant was entitled to have the claimed condition of ptsd as a war related disease 311 the tribunal was required to determine first whether the applicant was suffering from ptsd before proceeding to determine if the disease was war service related 312 the tribunal conflated the two questions depriving the applicant the benefit of the doubt in ascertaining whether he suffered a stressful event during his service 313 the test adopted by the tribunal throughout was that of the balance of probabilities whereas because of his operational service some of the circumstances surrounding the stressful events had to be given the more generous test of a reasonable hypothesis 32 the tribunal was wrong in law in the application of or in the failure to apply sections 119 120 1 3 and 120a of the veterans entitlements act and the decision of deledio v repatriation commission 321 these sections and the decision had application to determine the basis of a reasonable hypothesis whether the applicant had experienced a stressful event the tribunal erred in law in failing to apply the sections or the authority 323 the tribunal was required by law only to determine that the injuries claimed were not war caused if it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there were no sufficient grounds for making such a claim s 1201 to do so it had to raise the test of a reasonable hypothesis based on all the material before it s 1203 this the tribunal failed to do 324 the tribunal was wrong in law in requiring the applicant to provide objective evidence that he had encountered the bodies of the children whereas the tribunal was required to determine whether there was a reasonable hypothesis pointed out by the material that he had encountered the bodies the tribunal although rejecting the event as being neither truthful nor accurate did not challenge it pursuant to the requirements of s 1201 namely disprove it beyond reasonable doubt 325 the tribunal failed to apply s 1201 to the circumstances of the applicants case 326 it was insufficient for the tribunal to note that the circumstances of mortar and rocket fire did not accord with official records and that the events were not mentioned to two psychiatrists and to conclude that these were not traumatic events experienced by the applicant it was not appropriate for the tribunal to prefer the accuracy to the old official records of the events in relation to the shooting event the tribunal was required to ascertain whether the applicant had been exposed or confronted with a traumatic event regardless of the position of the body or whether or not he had entered the tent 327 the tribunal appears to confuse between what constituted a traumatic event and whether or not the event took place the tribunal conflates these two questions to the detriment of the applicant 33 the tribunal was wrong in law in determining the diagnosis of the condition of post traumatic stress disorder by reference to the statements of principle rather than the clinical evidence of psychiatrists who had interviewed the applicant 331 post traumatic stress disorder was diagnosed by both the psychiatrists commissioned by the applicant dr cole and dr holwill and the repatriation commission psychiatrists dr walton and dr gelb the tribunal failed to take into consideration these reports and the evidence given 34 the tribunal was wrong in law in the application of the statements of principle for post traumatic stress disorder 341 the tribunal was required to determine the most favourable of the statements of principle instead it used the more onerous 342 the tribunal was wrong in law in the standard of proof it adopted in determining whether the applicant met the requirements of the statements of principle for post traumatic stress disorder 35 the tribunal was wrong in law in failing to give adequate and proper consideration to the applicants claim for the condition of osteoarthrosis of the fingers of the right hand and in its determination that the right ear hearing problem was covered by the accepted disability of hearing loss of the left ear when there was a loss of hearing to the right side 351 the tribunal failed to provide clear reasons for rejection of osteoarthritis of the fingers of the right hand in which it needed to explain why pursuant to s 120 of the act it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was not war caused the appellant did not press this ground insofar as it dealt with hearing loss 36 this ground was not pressed 37 the tribunal was wrong in law in failing to provide sufficient and adequate reasons for its decision 371 the tribunal was required to do so pursuant to section 432b of the administrative appeals act 18 once the tribunal had concluded that the traumatic events described by mr masliczek had not occurred and that he was not suffering from ptsd there was no occasion for the tribunal to embark on the four step process which is outlined deledio in order to determine whether a nonexistent medical condition could be linked to operational service 19 mr masliczek submitted that it was not open to the tribunal having regard to the specialist medical evidence to find that he did not suffer from ptsd this submission must be rejected only one psychiatrist gave oral evidence that was dr walton dr walton made a diagnosis of ptsd on the basis of the bodies event the shooting event and the firing event as described by mr masliczek he did not consider that the taxi event or the casualty event were stressful in the necessary sense drs holwill cole and gelb whose reports were before the tribunal also diagnosed ptsd principally on the basis of the bodies event as the tribunal found this event did not occur the fifth doctor dr kenny did not diagnose ptsd the evidence did not therefore compel a finding that mr masliczek suffered from ptsd 20 during oral argument counsel for mr masliczek sought to argue that the tribunal had erred in the manner in which it dealt with the general anxiety and the depressive disorders which it found in paragraph 36 that mr masliczek suffered he argued that the tribunals reasons suggested that these conditions had been found not to be service related because mr masliczek had fallen at the third of the deledio steps he had not experienced a category 1a or a category 1b stressor as defined in statements of principles nos 101 of 2007 and 27 of 2008 it was argued that in accordance with the full courts decision in repatriation commission v keeley 2000 fca 532 2000 98 fcr 108 at 123 1312 the tribunal was required to consider whether earlier versions of these instruments which were in force at the time at which the primary decision on mr masliczeks claim was made might if applied have led to a favourable decision these earlier versions did not contain a requirement that an applicant must have experienced defined stressors during service the tribunal had not considered the earlier versions 23 grounds 35 deals with mr masliczeks claim that the osteoarthrosis of the fingers from which he suffers was service related the tribunal held that mr masliczek did not satisfy the first step which was identified in deledio 24 in deledio the full court explained the first step as follows at 97 1 the tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person no question of fact finding arises at this stage if no such hypothesis arises the application must fail 25 the tribunal noted that mr masliczek had attributed his painful fingers to injuries sustained while playing volleyball in vietnam it noted the reports of medical examinations conducted shortly after he was discharged from the army in 1968 those reports did not detect any injuries to his hand the tribunal also considered mr masliczeks evidence the tribunal determined that the material does not point to a hypothesis connecting the condition with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by him this conclusion was open to the tribunal none of the material pointed to the necessary connecting hypothesis 26 ground 37 as developed in argument directed attention to the way in which the tribunal had explained or failed to explain its reasons relating to mr masliczeks general anxiety and depressive disorders and his osteoarthrosis 30 paragraph 42 of the tribunals reasons has already been examined above at 23 to 25 the tribunal has adopted some shorthand expressions such as the first step from deledio nonetheless its reasoning processes as i have earlier summarised them are sufficiently clear in my opinion to satisfy its obligations under s 432b of the aat act 31 the appeal should be dismissed with costs i certify that the preceding thirtyone 31 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the

the applicant for reviews claim to have the review decided in his or her favour and must be integral to the decision the minister relied on a line of authority in the court in particular the decision of finn and stone jj in vaf v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs 2004 206 alr 471 at 478 33 moreover the minister submitted that to the extent that the tribunals reasons identified omissions in the claims made by the appellant in support of her application for a visa it was the omissions and nothing more which constituted the reason why or the integral part of the reasoning why the tribunal came to reject the appellants claim in that respect the minister relied upon what finn and stone jj had earlier said in the vaf v minister for immigration and multicultural

application of s 424a to say that there is no information here because the statement which is information lacked the aspect now being adduced would be to fail to recognize that the information that is central to the reason for the decision is that the appellant said so much and no more on an earlier occasion that is the relevant information

1512,12,25,361,273,42962,in his reasons for judgment ferdinands v chief of army 2008 fca 1865 lander j refused to grant the extension of time sought because no proper explanation had been offered for the delay and because there was no prospect of mr ferdinands succeeding in obtaining an order setting aside the termination decision at 41 4 counsel for the respondents properly raised the question whether the decision of lander j was an interlocutory decision or a final decision if the latter no leave to appeal from his decision was necessary if the former s 241a of the federal court of australia act 1976 cth provided that no appeal lay from that decision without leave leave to appeal may be given by a single judge s 252a under o 52 r 10 of the federal court rules leave to appeal is given in accordance with principles discussed in deacutecor corp pty ltd amp anor v dart industries inc 1991 fca 655 1991 33 fcr 397 in particular having regard to two main considerations namely whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration by the full court and whether substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal were refused supposing the decision to be wrong 6 i do not consider that decision dictates that the decision of lander j in the present matter was a final order so that no leave to appeal is necessary that is because this proceeding unlike the proceeding in paramasivam did not seek to enforce an existing alleged cause of action which had become statute barred by the elapse of time in other words there was no claimed legal right which mr ferdinands was seeking to enforce his application was for an extension of time within which to apply for an order to show cause why the termination decision should not be set aside it was necessary for him even had he applied for such an order within time to satisfy a justice of the high court or if the matter were remitted to this court a judge of this court that it was appropriate for an order to show cause to be issued moreover as mchugh acj gummow and heydon jj said in re luck 2003 hca 70 2003 203 alr 1 at 4 the usual test for determining whether an order is final or interlocutory is whether the order as made finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them that question is answered by determining whether the legal effect of the judgment is final or not if the legal effect of the judgment is final it is a final order otherwise it is an interlocutory order original emphasis citations omitted 8 accordingly i consider that mr ferdinands correctly approached the matter on the basis that he required leave to appeal from the decision of lander j 9 mr ferdinands made detailed written submissions about why leave to appeal should be granted in essence he said it was in the interests of justice to grant leave he briefly developed them orally however his submissions really amounted to no more than a way of describing the nature of his claim they did not pay sufficient attention to the particular circumstances i invited him to indicate where he contended lander j had fallen into error in his consideration of that application for an extension of time to apply for the order to show cause in my view mr ferdinands was unable to indicate any such error either in the description of the history relevant to consideration of that application or in identifying the grounds advanced by mr ferdinands in support of it or in his honours consideration of those grounds i shall advert to them again shortly 10 there are two additional matters which mr ferdinands raised apparently for the first time on this application the first is his assertion that crennan j had no power to remit the matter to this court for hearing and determination he had not objected to the remittal order when it was made nor had he raised that point before lander j he did not develop any argument in support of the proposition it is plainly wrong see s 44 of the judiciary act 1903 cth secondly he argued that the delegate of the chief of army had no power to terminate his employment in the way that had been done because ss 5 and 10 of the defence force discipline act 1982 cth were involved again that matter had not been raised in his original application nor before lander j no notice of that matter had been given to the respondents other than in a generic way in his draft proposed notice of appeal exhibited to his affidavit sworn on 8 december 2008 where it is said that that section 10 of the defence force discipline act 1982 application of the criminal code is declared invalid in law and all associated subsections are declared invalid including section 162 163 and 165a no detailed argument was developed in support of the contention as it was not raised previously it is unfair to the respondents to have been confronted with it only on this application and more importantly as it was not raised before lander j it cannot provide a basis for demonstrating that his honours reasoning was erroneous and that leave to appeal from it should be given 11 i return to the matters which were argued before lander j 12 mr ferdinands orally suggested in a general way that the history recorded by lander j and the description of the matters or grounds upon which the application to show cause was made were misunderstood by his honour closer questioning of mr ferdinands indicated that he did not identify any particular respect in which his honour misunderstood either of those aspects of his claim i will not refer to the detail of them he was unable to demonstrate any arguable error in those respects 13 it became apparent in the course of his oral submissions on this application that the thrust of mr ferdinands complaint is that he was wrongly convicted in the adelaide magistrates court of assault and wrongly convicted by a defence force magistrate of a separate assault upon a service personnel he argued that the delegate of the chief of army was wrong to have taken into account those convictions in deciding to terminate his employment as lander j said at 8 in essence he seeks to use the proceeding to show cause to overturn those convictions moreover as lander j pointed out at 38 the proposed proceeding is an attempt to quash the decision by a collateral attack upon the conviction by the defence force magistrate 14 mr ferdinands was convicted by a defence force magistrate of one charge of assault upon an inferior officer on 4 november 1999 he belatedly sought to appeal from that decision on 17 april 2001 the president of the defence force disciplinary appeal tribunal on 15 august 2001 refused to grant an extension of time to appeal he appealed from that decision also on 16 august 2002 that tribunal extended the time for filing of an appeal but dismissed the appeal mr ferdinands then appealed to this court from that decision that appeal was dismissed on 11 february 2003 ferdinands v chief of army 2003 fcafc 10 he applied to the high court for special leave to appeal from that decision that application was deemed to be abandoned for failure to comply with the high court rules on 1 october 2003 as lander j said his application for an extension of time to apply for an order to show cause should not be granted when it was or to the extent that it was seeking to make a collateral attack upon that conviction 15 the fact that mr ferdinands was seeking collaterally to attack the defence force magistrates conviction was reinforced by his complaints about the conduct of that hearing in particular that certain witnesses had not been called and certain documents had not been produced which he claimed ought to have been produced on that hearing 16 mr ferdinands raised an additional point on this application for leave to appeal apparently for the first time that he could not have been terminated by a decision of the delegate of the chief of army because following that conviction the prosecuting officer had asked for the termination of his employment but the defence force magistrate had imposed a lesser penalty hence he said the defence force magistrate had decided that termination of his employment as a member of the defence force was not an appropriate penalty for the conviction and the chief of army could not then reach a different view or impose an additional penalty the proposition oversimplifies the grounds upon which the decision to terminate his employment was made the material before the court indicates that the facts and circumstances relating to the reason for terminating his service were that conviction a conviction for assault in the adelaide magistrates court on 27 february 2001 together with evidence about mr ferdinands character then provided relative to penalty in that court the termination of his civilian employment on 21 november 2001 and more generally his attitude towards others and towards authority the evidence does not support mr ferdinands assertion as the point was not raised before lander j even if it were correct it could not show arguable error at first instance and the proposition even if correct inappropriately conflates the punishment imposed for an offence with the assessment of suitability to remain in particular employment 17 mr ferdinands also criticised the approach of lander j in deciding whether there was an adequate explanation for the delay in making the primary application his honour properly identified the principles as discussed by mchugh j in gallo v dawson 1990 hca 30 1990 93 alr 479 at 480 in my view nothing was identified to suggest that his honour has misunderstood or misapplied them he recognised the disadvantage applicable to mr ferdinands by reason of his impecuniosity and by reason of his need to be selfrepresented 18 so far as i can determine although not dealt with in the draft proposed notice of appeal the only other matter advanced on this application for leave to appeal was an assertion that lander j had incorrectly struck out an affidavit of mr ferdinands of 4 may 2007 as an abuse of process his honour ruled that he would not receive paras 135 of that affidavit but received the remainder of that affidavit it was entirely proper to have rejected those paragraphs of that affidavit they did not relate to any issue relevant to the primary application they contained a series of unrelated and offensive allegations against persons who were not parties to it the balance of that affidavit comprises matters which his honour regarded as potentially relevant to the application which he was considering 19 i have therefore come to the view that mr ferdinands application must be refused he has not identified any matter in which lander j might have fallen into error even arguably so he has not advanced any matter which specifically explains the delay between the making of the decision which he wishes to attack and the application for an extension of time to have made the application in those circumstances neither of the principles upon which an extension of time might be granted has been activated 20

17893,44,31,129,124,37188,apm then submitted in reliance upon the principles enunciated in ron kingham real estate pty ltd v edgar 1999 2 qd r 439 at 443 per mcpherson ja that there would be no benefit to the creditors in the trustee company being wound up and it was trite law that a creditor can claim to be subrogated to the right of indemnity of the trustee company and directly enforce the debt against the trust assets or even the beneficiaries personally 35 the way in which these submissions were put seemed to relate both to the question of solvency and the discretion to be exercised by the court as to whether to order a winding up assuming i was not satisfied as to solvency as a matter of procedure apm moved the court for its removal as trustee the appointment of a receiver and that a winding up not be ordered by the court 38 as to apms reliance on ron kingham real estate 2 qd r 439 in that case the question of whether the trustee had properly incurred liabilities was not a matter that was or could be in contention the defendants could not having authorised the action of the trustee have complained of a breach of trust 39 putting aside the correctness of the decision in ron kingham real estate 2 qd r 439 in allowing the trustees creditor to sue trust beneficiaries directly to enforce the trustees right of indemnity against the beneficiaries i do not consider it appropriate where there is an issue or potential issue as to whether the right of indemnity is available in the circumstances of this case to conclude that the creditors should be left to pursue such claims individually in any event there is no evidence that there will be sufficient assets to pay the creditors after the secured creditors have been paid i do not consider that apms contentions relating to the right of indemnity demonstrate that apm is solvent assuming that at law there is a right of indemnity in favour of apm or that such right of indemnity is a factor in favour of exercising my discretion not to wind up the company if a liquidator is appointed he will be well placed to consider and deal with the question of the right of indemnity and pursue with priority claims over the beneficiaries 40 i now turn to other discretionary matters raised by apm and the issue of apm continuing as a trustee and the appointment of a receiver 41 as i have indicated above it was contended that if i came to the conclusion that apm had not discharged the burden of proof to show it was solvent i should not order the winding up of the company but should instead remove it as trustee and appoint a receiver over the trust assets in support of this approach evidence was led of a number of creditors who expressed a desire for such a course it was argued that it would save time and costs if the appropriate person already familiar with the company was appointed in this case mr andrew leonard dunner it was further contended that with the number of actions threatened against the company a receiver would be in a better position to defend the company with the aid of the current director that the principal director mr edwards who was responsible for the bad state of the books of accounts of the company is no longer involved with apm and that the current director is taking steps to put the books of accounts in proper order and prepare proper financial statements 42 in addition it was argued that because of the operation clause 11 in the memorandum of agreement between apm and the developer rocco antonio calderone dated 3 august 2005 in the event of the appointment of a liquidator apm would not be able to rely upon its right of indemnity as the developer would be released from its duties and obligations under the agreement and the trust properties would vest in the hands of the beneficiaries 43 i have come to the view that i should order the winding up of apm despite these contentions in addition to the views i have expressed in coming to the view that apm has not discharged the burden of proof upon it and my views on the report of mr miller of 30 august 2007 i have concluded that apm should be wound up and that the alternative course of action contended for by apm not be followed for the following reasons i whilst some creditors do not want the appointment of a liquidator this is not the universal view of the unsecured creditors and in any event is not a decisive factor ii whilst the appointment of a receiver familiar with the company already may save some time and costs this is not the important consideration when balanced against the important public interest of ensuring an insolvent company ceases trading even if only a presumed insolvent company iii clause 11 does not in my view release the developer from any past responsibilities or liabilities it may have had under the agreement all it seems to do is to release upon the appointment of a liquidator the developer from any further duties and obligations under the agreement from the date of the appointment in any event even if clause 11 does have the result as contended for by apm including the vesting of trust property in the beneficiary the other factors i have relied upon in these reasons would indicate that it is appropriate for the company to be wind up the public interest being a paramount consideration where apm is unable to prove its solvency and the books of accounts are incomplete and are unsubstantiated upon vesting of the trust property in the beneficiaries the company will still have a beneficial interest with priority over the beneficiaries if as trustee it has a right of indemnity as submitted if the debts have been incurred in the administration of the trust the liquidator can call upon the right of indemnity iv i do not consider that there are now better prospects for the creditors as a whole including the unsecured creditors if the company with or without a receiver were allowed to continue to trade on

purposes however it is helpful to refer specifically to several principles that have particular resonance with the circumstances of this case 1 the underlying consideration in the construction of the patent is that it is a public instrument conferring a public monopoly that is meant to define the monopoly in such a way that it is not capable of being misunderstood see eg pfizer at 52 247 the patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and to allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct that is prohibited see eg clorox at 261 18 2 the claims define the invention which is the subject of the patent they must be construed according to their terms by applying the ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument see eg deacutecor at 400 clorox at 260 15 3 the claims must be construed in the context of the specification as a whole the rest of the specification may explain the background to the claims assist in ascertaining the meaning of technical terms or aid in resolving ambiguities in the construction of the claims clorox at 260 16 sachtler at 381 42 4 although the claims are to be construed in the context of the specification as a whole the settled rule is that it is not permissible to vary or qualify the plain or unambiguous meaning of the claim by reference to the body of the specification see interlego per barwick cj and mason j at 478 further it is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of monopoly as fixed by the words of a claim by adding to those words glosses drawn from other parts of the specification similarly if a claim be clear it is not to be made obscure simply because obscurities can be found in particular sentences in other parts of the document welch perrin at 610 per dixon cj kitto and windeyer jj see also clorox at 261 17 5 a patent specification must be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction this involves construing the claims in a practical commonsense manner avoiding too technical or narrow a construction of the claims and preferring a construction under which the invention will work to one where it may not work pfizer at 5354 citing nesbit evans group australia pty ltd v impro ltd 1997 39 ipr 56 it also means construing the claims in light of what a reasonable person to whom the patent was addressed would have understood the language of the claim to mean kirinamgen at 453454 30 32 and 34 per lord hoffman 6 the hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the noninventive person skilled in the art before the priority date the words used in the specification and the claim are to be given the meaning that the skilled addressee would attach to them both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification clorox at 261262 20 deacutecor at 391 photocure at 85 170 7 the proper construction of the specification is a matter of law for the court to determine however evidence can be given by experts on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings given by such persons to words that might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning see clorox at 262 21 see also root quality pty ltd v root control 2000 49 ipr 225 root quality at 237 49 146 ranbaxy argued that the actions that warnerlambert had to take after 30 may 1986 to develop and market a single enantiomeric drug showed that the practical difficulties to which it pointed were very real in particular ranbaxy referred to the fact that warnerlambert encountered difficulties with racemic atorvastatin lactone in mid 1987 at that point it decided to resolve the racemate into its individual enantiomers and on 1 february 1989 warnerlambert filed a united states patent application directed to the process it had developed for the chiral synthesis of enantiomers of atorvastatin lactone assuming that it is appropriate on a question of construction to have regard to these subsequent events these matters do not affect my conclusion as to the proper construction of the 981 patent on the evidence before me there was a common expectation prior to 30 may 1986 that single enantiomeric drugs could be commercially produced whether by way of resolution or chiral synthesis the fact that there were numerous single enantiomeric drugs on the market by that stage confirmed this expectation the possibility that difficulties may be encountered in developing an enantomeric drug for commercial sale does not have the consequence in my view that the 981 patent should be read down so that it only claims racemic mixtures it must be borne in mind that the patent is concerned with the grant of a monopoly in respect of the claimed compounds for a period of 20 years there is no reason to doubt that there was a general expectation that means could be found to develop methods of synthesising single enantomeric drugs for commercial sale over that time frame to my mind it is unreasonable to suppose that the patent was intended to be confined to racemates simply because difficulties might arise in the near term in producing a single enantiomeric drug on a commercial scale in any event i have grave doubts that subsequent conduct of the kind to which ranbaxy refers in this argument as distinct from the surrounding commercial circumstances at 30 may 1986 can properly be used as an extrinsic aid to the proper construction of the 981 patent cf fai

21063,48,37,331,99,2618,recently a question very similar to that which arises in this case arose before buchanan j in an application for civil penalties by an australian building and construction commission inspector alfred v lanscar 2007 fca 833 as part of an investigation into alleged breaches of the wr act statements were taken from a number of people they were signed and witnessed the commission subsequently sought to rely upon affidavits sworn or affirmed by people from whom the statements were taken in which they deposed to the truth and accuracy of the statements and exhibited them to the affidavits eight statements adopted in that fashion were relied upon at the hearing before buchanan j as part of evidenceinchief in the applicants case 20 buchanan j ruled that the witness statements were made admissible by their adoption in the affidavits although his ruling was made in the course of the hearing his honour subsequently reduced his reasons for decision to writing 21 buchanan j referred to s 37 of the evidence act 1995 cth and in particular s 373 which contemplates the exercise by a court of power in the rules of court to allow a written statement or report to be tendered or treated as evidenceinchief of its maker a question arose whether the statements adopted by the witnesses were hearsay within the meaning of s 59 of the evidence act his honour held that if they were they would fall within an exception to the hearsay rule in s 63 and not be inadmissible for that reason he referred to the decision of the full court in platcher v jones 2004 fcafc 68 he did not read the observations of their honours as turning on the requirements of s 19 of the australian securities and investments commission act i respectfully agree with his honours observations his honour rejected the objection taken to the admissibility of the statements he also rejected a separate submission that the court should require the evidence to be given orally in any event he saw no reason to depart from earlier directions that the conduct of the proceedings be by affidavit his honour said at 4 in the circumstances i will admit the statements in question in the sense that i will not exclude them from the evidence upon the basis which has so far been argued however it follows that if the statements are to be treated as part of the evidence in chief as i think they should be then they will be subject to objections in the ordinary way upon some other foundation if that appears to be available such objections will need to be dealt with as they are taken i reject the objection so far taken in a general way to the statements in question

1 ac 615 at 743 as to the operation of the principle of abuse of process the collateral attack point is a species or subset of abuse of process there is no general rule preventing a party inviting a court to arrive at a decision inconsistent with that arrived at in another case the law of estoppel per rem judicatam and issue estoppel define when a party is entitled to do this generally there must be an identification of the parties in the instant case with those in the previous case and there are exceptions so far as questions of law are concerned absent a decision specifically binding upon the relevant litigant the doctrine of precedent governs when an earlier legal decision may be challenged in a later case a party is not in general bound by a previous decision unless he has been a party or privy to it or has been expressly or implicitly covered by some order for the marshalling of litigation ashmore v british coal corpn 1990 2 qb 338 this overlaps with the concept of vexation where the same person is faced with successive actions making the same allegations which have already been fully investigated in a previous case in which the later claimant had an opportunity to take part this reasoning does not apply to an action against a lawyer alleging that he has mishandled a previous case i have earlier made reference to dictum of lord hoffman appearing in arthur s hall in the context of my earlier citation from spalla of the public policy element which assists to define the scope of the doctrine of abuse of process and i have of course already discussed the judicial notion of privy the taxpayer applicants contended that it could not be said that they had an opportunity to take part in what was described by them as a contest over the liability to tax in respect of other years and in respect of other taxpayers that contention was contextually related to the further proposition of the taxpayer applicants that the commissioners submission that the present taxpayers and spassked are controlled by the same entity is in the present circumstances irrelevant to the question of abuse of process i have difficulty in understanding why that should be so control by the same corporate entity for instance the control of a holding company over its wholly owned subsidiaries may surely be a factor of potential relevance to the resolution of an issue as to abuse of process which focuses upon the conduct of the controlled entity and a relevantly related company especially in circumstances of entire ie wholly owned shareholding control as exemplified in passages i have earlier extracted from the judgments in spassked at first instance and appeal evidence was led as to the operations activities and decision making of and in relation to iel wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries comprising the taxpayer applicants in particular in relation to periods of time both prior and subsequent to the 1992 fiscal years a similar observation is seemingly apposite to the purported reliance by the taxpayer applicants upon the following dictum of heydon ja as he then was and with whom spigelman cj and mason p agreed in r v ohalloran 2000 nswcca 528 2000 36 acsr 315 at 342344 in the course of which his honour observed that the law prevents mrs fenwick relitigating in civil proceedings issues decided in earlier civil proceedings it does not necessarily prevent a nonparty namely the director litigating issues for the first time in criminal proceedings what of course is here relevantly involved are civil proceedings alone
2516,4,6,346,338,6567,the commissioner submitted that it is a fundamental defect in barms argument that it impermissibly seeks to make derivation of the income amount the debtpayment in respect of management services dependent upon the capacity to recover the capital asset arising from investment of the income the debt owing by pgf apart from the illogicality of the contended dependence it is relevant to note that even if there had been an impediment to recovery of the debt on income account that would not lead to the result that it would not have been derived as income in barratt at 232 gummow j northrop and drummond jj agreeing drew attention to the distinction between a the situation where a debt has not come into existence with the result that income will not have been derived an example of which was federal commissioner of taxation v australian gas light co 1983 74 flr 13 and b the situation where a debt has come into existence but there is an impediment to recovery accordingly statutory prohibitions against recovery of fees for medical services pursuant to s 352 of the medical practitioners act 1938 nsw were only impediments to enforcement that did not lead to the result that taxpayers assessable on an accruals basis had not derived the fees as income
1684,23,30,378,287,5218,carefully studied the redacted parts of the respondents affidavit i have concluded that they should not be made available to the applicants legal advisers even on the giving of appropriate undertakings there are many cases that establish that courts should attach very considerable weight to the view of what national security requires as is expressed by the responsible officer see for example leghaei v directorgeneral of security 2007 fcafc 56 at 56 58 62 although usually expressed in connection with the inspection of protected documents themselves those observations apply also to an affidavit such as that sworn in this case which supplies the reasons for the claim to privilege in the open part of his affidavit the respondent says that the disclosure of the redacted portions of his affidavit would be likely to prejudice national security in the balance of the affidavit in particular the redacted parts he explains the basis for his opinion having read those parts i am satisfied that the opinion is soundly based accordingly the respondent may rely on his affidavit in support of his public interest claim without providing to the applicants legal representatives the redacted parts thereof the next question is whether the respondents public interest immunity claims should be upheld in church of scientology v woodward 1982 hca 78 1980 154 clr 25 at 76 brennan j said discovery would not be given against the directorgeneral of security save in a most exceptional case the secrecy of the work of an intelligence organization which is to counter espionage sabotage etc is essential to national security and the public interest in national security will seldom yield to the public interest in the administration of civil justice the veil of secrecy is not absolutely impenetrable but the veil is not penetrated merely by a plaintiffs deposition that he is not a security risk that after all may be the very matter which is under investigation see also leghaei v directorgeneral of security 2007 fcafc at 52 and r v khazaal 2006 nswsc at 3132
24159,23,40,219,67,10167,the high court said that the common law principles of procedural fairness required the tribunal to advise the applicants of the substance of the allegations in the letter the tribunal was not required to give the applicants a copy of the letter or provide any information which would have identified the author of the letter at 7 the court referred to certain statutory provisions but said that in the circumstances the case was to be decided by reference to the common law principles of procedural fairness the court referred to the reasons for judgment of brennan j in kioa v west 1985 hca 81 1985 159 clr 550 at 628629 the court concluded that the tribunal had an obligation to draw the applicants attention to the information in the letter the court then said at 98 2223 the fact that the author of the letter asked the department to keep it secret did not mean that equitable principles about confidential information were to be engaged in deciding what course the tribunal took rather the nature and extent of the tribunals obligation to disclose the information were regulated by the act and the obligation to accord the appellant procedural fairness in this case the particular content of the obligation to accord procedural fairness was to be identified having regard not only to the particular provisions of the act that regulated the tribunals work but also to the scope and objects of the act as a whole in that latter regard it is necessary to keep two propositions at the forefront of consideration first the act required that those entitled to a particular visa be granted the visa they sought and that those not entitled be refused secondly the act committed the decision to grant or refuse a visa to the executive government and the tribunal was likewise exercising executive power not judicial power 57 the court said that there was a public interest in the executive government when making its decision not being denied information that has been or may later be supplied by an informer at 98 24 that public interest and the rules of procedural fairness could be accommodated by a requirement that the applicant be advised of substance of the allegations and asking him to respond to those allegations at 100 29 the court concluded that the tribunal had not complied with the rules of procedural fairness 58 the decision in veal suggests that in this case the minister was obliged to disclose to the applicant the substance of the information in the parole board reports the minister sought to meet the difficulty caused by the fact that he had not done so by submitting that the obligation did not arise in this case because the information in the parole board reports was either information from the applicant or was information which was not adverse to the applicant or was information he already had from other sources the other sources identified by the applicant were a report of mr sowerbutts dated 29 august 2006 and ms beevors report a decisionmakers obligation of disclosure where the common law rules of procedural fairness apply has been discussed in a number of cases i need go no further than refer to the two wellknown decisions of kioa v west supra at 628629 per brennan j commissioner for australian capital territory revenue v alphaone pty ltd 1994 49 fcr 576 at 588592 59 in this case the minister presented a schedule of the information in the parole board reports and of where he said it either came from the applicant or was not adverse or was known to the applicant from other sources the minister did not submit that there was not information in the parole board reports which was credible relevant and significant to the decision to be made kioa v west supra at 629 per brennan j there are obvious difficulties with the ministers submission for example unless the same words are used it will sometimes be difficult to determine if the information provided by the applicant or said to have been available from another source is actually the same information which the applicant claims ought to have been disclosed 60 in this case there clearly was information in the parole board reports which was adverse and was not provided by the applicant or to him from other sources that information related to concerns about where the applicant proposed to live in relation to his victim the substance of that information should have been disclosed to the applicant the applicant now has the parole board reports and it is not necessary for me to go further and express a conclusion in relation to each piece of information in the parole board reports 61 the applicant has established a breach of the rules of procedural fairness 62 the applicant submitted that by reason of the decisionmakers conduct he was denied the opportunity to put his case and has been denied procedural fairness of course the minister and the officers of his department did not prevent the applicant from putting forward whatever information he considered appropriate in fact he was encouraged by an officer of the ministers department to put his best foot forward however his case is that by reason of a representation made to him he did not put forward all the information he would otherwise put forward 63 two decisions of the high court have dealt with the question of whether there had been a breach of the rules of

20594,74,38,243,75,4784,ircsa appeal was listed for hearing on 30 april 2009 on 2 april 2009 his honour senior judge jennings gave directions for the exchange of outlines of submissions in relation to both the jurisdictional issue and the merits of the appeal it is unclear what the jurisdictional issue is it may be that there is an issue as to whether an appeal lies without the making of orders although as noted in 8 of these reasons s 1871 of the fw act would appear to accommodate such an appeal it may be that there is an issue whether that appeal is competent having regard to the matter including the federal element and the provisions of ss 8502 and 853 of the wr act as to that see the decision in iss health v duthie 2007 sairc 94 at 45 see also kronen v commercial motor industries pty ltd cmi toyota 2008 fcafc 171 kronen at 4 and 7 it may be that the appeal may be incompetent because it is not an appeal from the whole of the decision but only that part of it which related to the period up to 26 march 2006 in kronen 2008 fcafc 171 an industrial magistrate of the ircsa had considered claims for underpayment of wages for overtime work and for underpayment of superannuation contributions the written reasons for judgment dismissed the claim for overtime pay but made no order reflecting the industrial magistrates conclusions on the superannuation claim the full court gray branson and lander jj observed at 14 the industrial magistrate made no order reflecting the conclusions he had reached on the superannuation claim he neither dismissed the claim which he was bound to do if he came to the conclusion that he had no power to order the making of payments nor made any purported declaration reflecting the conclusion to which he had come as to the meaning and effect of the provisions of the award relating to superannuation his honour seems to have thought that the expression of a conclusion in his reasons for judgment was sufficient it was not the whole of the application by summons before the court needed to be dealt with plainly because the court lacked jurisdiction to deal with the superannuation claim that aspect of the application was required to be dismissed there is nothing in the fw act which continues the existence of ircsa established first under the industrial relations act 1972 sa which requires its decisions to be reflected in formally drawn orders so that its orders must be drawn up and sealed nor is there anything in the south australian industrial proceedings rules sa dealing with those topics in kronen 2008 fcafc 171 the full court clearly accepted that the expression of an order dismissing the claim for overtime payments in the reasons for decision was sufficient to enliven the right of appeal subject to granting leave to appeal if that were necessary see at 15 clearly that decision is different from the present circumstances it is clear that the fact that the ircsa does not routinely draw up formal orders after a decision including reasons for decision does not of itself impede the right of appeal under s 853 of the wr act see kronen 2008 fcafc 171 it therefore falls to consider whether the industrial magistrate in particular by 39 of his reasons set out above has in substance finally determined the issue as to how the parties legal rights are to be assessed had the word determine been substituted for the word conclude or been used in conjunction with it there would in my view have been no scope for debate about that the limited liberty to apply as to the quantum reflects such an intention in my view the existence or otherwise of a right of appeal should not be determined by the precise word or words used but by their substantive effect i do not need to decide that issue because the appellant has taken upon itself to have this appeal dismissed however i think there is at least a reasonable basis to conclude that the industrial magistrate intended to and did finally determine the issue of principle in a binding way and that his expression at the conclusion of his reasons was intended to and did operate in that way in any event if there were any ambiguity the industrial magistrate could have been asked to clarify the meaning of 39 of his reasons so as to indicate whether he intended it to be the operative judicial determination of that issue or further his honour could have been asked to make such an operative judicial determination the notice of appeal filed in the federal court in the latter event could have been allowed to stand as if that operative determination had been made at the time of the publication of the reasons and any necessary extension of time granted no party would thereby have been prejudiced and indeed the respondent opposed the stay motion and wanted to proceed with the appeal i turn to consider the issue of the costs of the appeal section 824 of the wr act relevantly provides 1 a party to a proceeding including an appeal in a matter arising under this act must not be ordered to pay costs incurred by any other party to the proceeding unless the firstmentioned party instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause 2 despite subsection 1 if a court hearing a proceeding including an appeal in a matter arising under this act is satisfied that a party to the proceeding has by an unreasonable act or omission caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding the court may order the firstmentioned party to pay some or all of those costs 3 in subsections 1 and 2 costs includes all legal and professional costs and disbursements and expenses of witnesses

of bankruptcy was a superior court and williams j whose dissent was not on this point said at 607 when therefore the federal court of bankruptcy has made a sequestration order under the act it is not in my opinion a nullity so that even if it has been irregularly obtained it operates until it is set aside and causes the debtor to become a bankrupt and his property to vest in the official receiver the sequestration order in the present case is therefore at worst voidable and was effective to bankrupt ms cross when it was made the question of whether it can truly be seen to be voidable depends upon the applicability and operation of s 306 section 306 only applies to a formal defect or an irregularity but where that precondition is satisfied it operates automatically kleinwort benson australia ltd v crowl 1988 hca 34 165 clr 71 at 81 as the high court said in adams v lambert 2006 hca 10 2006 225 alr 396 at 24 the composite expression a formal defect or an irregularity conveys a meaning with elements of both inclusion and exclusion the court went on to say at 26 the question of construction raised by the words a formal defect or an irregularity is one to be decided by reading s 306 in the context of the whole act informed by the general purpose of the legislation and the particular purpose of the provisions relating to bankruptcy notices it is similar to the question that in former times would be explained by asking whether a statutory requirement was mandatory or directory in project blue sky inc v australian broadcasting authority it was said a better test is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of a provision should be invalid in determining the question of purpose regard must be had to the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute the high court also held that the kind or degree of breach is relevant to a consideration of s 306 and that if a defect could cause substantial injustice it may not easily be classified as a formal defect or irregularity see 18 22 ultimately the characterisation of a defect as formal or substantive is a matter for judgment however it is first necessary to consider as the high court has indicated the legislative regime in relation to in this case creditors petitions a useful starting point is the analysis of burchett j in re millar ex parte commonwealth development bank of australia no 3881993 unreported 27 april 1993 where his honour first set out what the full court had said in ginnane v diners club limited 1993 120 alr 375 at 376 paragraph 521b of the bankruptcy act provides that at the hearing of a creditors petition the court shall require proof of the service of the petition and if it is satisfied with the proof of that service as well as the other matters specified in subsection 521 it may make a sequestration order against the estate of the debtor subsection 522 provides among other things that if the court is not satisfied with the proof of the service of the petition it may dismiss the petition these provisions illustrate a unique prescription relating to a petition for a sequestration order a sequestration order affects the status of a person the legislature in recognition of this feature has insisted that the petitioner must prove among other things service of the petition on the debtor burchett j went on to say if one turns to s 52 of the act the force of what their honours say is immediately apparent it is a peculiar feature of litigation under the bankruptcy act upon a creditors petition that the court is expressly required to hear proof of service of the petition and is expressly required if it is not satisfied with the proof among other things of that matter to dismiss the petition it seems to me very difficult to regard s 306 as capable of avoiding the consequences of any serious default in respect of the requirements regarding the service of the petition so specifically stated in s 52 on the basis that such a serious default would be a mere formal defect or an irregularity the requirements of s 52 are essential requirements for the proof of the petition they are made essential no doubt because the law recognises that proceedings in bankruptcy have an extraordinarily far reaching effect not only upon the status of the debtor but also so as to convert in some cases actions and omissions of his in the past which at the time they were done or omitted did not constitute any offence into serious criminal offences it is clear from what his honour said that having regard to the purposes of the statutory regime a serious breach of the requirements of service was intended by the legislature to lead to invalidity in the sense that it would not constitute a mere formal defect to which s 306 would apply this analysis echoes what the high court said in adams v lambert namely that the kind or degree of the breach is relevant to a consideration of s 306 in re ditfort ex parte dct 1988 19 fcr 347 which was an application for annulment gummow j expressed agreement with the proposition advanced by walters j in re long ex parte fraser confirming pty ltd 1975 12 sasr 130 that there is a necessity for strictness of proof in observance of the requirements for service of bankruptcy notices and bankruptcy petitions his honour said at 359 360 whilst not necessarily being of the view that s 306 can never apply in such a case in any circumstances i respectfully agree with what was said by his honour as to the importance of proper proof in these cases and as to the salutary consequences for creditors of failure to comply with the rules in this case the relevant rules are of course the provisions of o 43 r 13 which set in place a special regime for service the provisions of subrule 136 reflect the position in england as it became after judicature see t snow et a the annual practice 11 th edn sweet amp maxwell london 1893 at 248 t w chitty chittys archbolds practice of

or person of unsound mind not so found by inquisition is a defendant to the action service on the committee of the lunatic or on the person with whom the person of unsound mind resides or under whose care he or she is shall unless the court or judge otherwise orders be deemed good service on such defendant emphasis added in the fore street warehouse company limited v durrant amp co 1883 10 qbd 471 the writ had been served on the lunatic defendants business manager grove j said of the rule at 473 i think the principle of this rule is that the service should be on some person qualified to act for the lunatic or most likely to know to whom the fact of service ought to be communicated the manager of the lunatics business might be ignorant of these matters where the writ is served in such a manner that it may probably never reach the lunatic i do not think it can be valid and proper service the plaintiffs may reasonably be required to go through the formalities which may give the friends of the lunatic a proper opportunity of appearing it is also useful to consider what has been said about the next step in the process contemplated by the rules namely the appointment of a next friend or tutor the rules of the supreme court of new south wales and in particular those which preceded the recent uniform civil procedure regime are in a similar form to those which operate in this court in state rail authority of new south wales v hammond 1988 15 nswlr 395 kirby p with whom hope and mahoney jja agreed explained at 400 that the provisions of pt 63 r 2 which establishes the procedural requirement of a next friend are simply machinery or procedure provisions they are designed principally to ensure that there is someone answerable to the court on behalf of the litigant with a disability that crucial decisions affecting that litigant can be properly and responsibly made and that a person exists who can bear any costs as are ordered against the person with the disability at the end of the litigation two features of the language of o 43 r 13 merit particular consideration first while the machinery provisions of o 43 r 13 namely subrules 3 6 use the word may one must take into account subrule 2 which provides 2 personal service on a person under a disability shall not be effected otherwise than in accordance with this rule second a certain tension seems to arise within the rule when ones comes to subrule 4 which provides 4 the document may be served on any person including the person under disability whom the court may before or after service approve however when one bears in mind the purpose of this rule and its place in the broader rules as to litigation involving disabled persons there is no tension between subrules 2 and 4 one can readily imagine a case where the court would approve a particular person upon whom service could be effected indeed it would be a prudent course to obtain such approval in advance of proceeding against a disabled person on the other hand where service has taken place in breach of the rule but those who care for the disabled person nevertheless appear at court and no injustice has been occasioned by the breach of the rules one appreciates how the court might approve service which has already taken place the discretion in subrule 4 is premised upon the mandatory nature of the rule as reflected in the language of subrule 2 where the objects of the rule have otherwise been achieved it facilitates the proceedings moving forward by validating service which would have otherwise been prohibited it is also important to note that the rules expressly reject the idea that one might serve perhaps out of an abundance of caution both the person designated by subrule 136 and the mentally disabled person with an initiating process such as a creditors petition the course which is not only to be preferred but which appears to be required is to approach the court for a grant of approval only in relation to the limited class of documents in subrule 8 is a different approach to be adopted thus in their general application the special rules as to service firmly ensure that their aim is attained namely that an opportunity is afforded to those who care for a mentally disabled person to appear before the court and to represent and protect that persons interests where by definition he or she does not have the capacity to do so alone the existence of a facility for the proceedings to move forward once that aim has been achieved does not detract from the control which the court maintains over this step in proceedings against mentally disabled persons in bankruptcy proceedings the legislature has protected all debtors by requiring proof of service of the petition in every instance in the case of mentally disabled persons that protection extends to the requirement to serve in accordance with the special rules designed to ensure that the opportunity is a real one in my judgment strict compliance with the provisions of o 43 r 13 is necessary in bankruptcy proceedings a breach of these rules could result in substantial injustice being visited upon the disabled respondent moreover a serious breach could defeat the intention of the o 43 altogether and lead to a breach of the fundamental rules of natural justice the fcr require service upon a particular person and that was not done the fcr also prohibit service upon the disabled person and that was ignored the conduct of the creditor constituted a serious breach of the fcr and resulted in a defect in the proceedings which was not a formal one section 306 does not apply and the sequestration order is voidable the separate question of whether substantial injustice has been occasioned by the defect in these proceedings does not arise in any event i am of the opinion that in all the circumstances of this case substantial injustice has been occasioned by the defect which cannot be remedied by order of the court save to set aside the sequestration order and dismiss the petition the annulment issue it is quite clear that ms cross should not have been bankrupted she was solvent at the time a creditor who issues a creditors petition runs the risk that if the debtor is solvent the likelihood is that the petition will be dismissed with costs the evidence suggests that ms cross due to her state of mind may have thought that the body corporate of her home unit building did not exist and that she therefore did not owe it any money whether that be right or not bankruptcy proceedings are not for debtors who wont pay debts they are for debtors who cant pay debts as the full court said in sarina v council of the shire of wollondilly 1980 48 flr 372 at 376 in bankruptcy rights of creditors to sue the bankrupt are converted into rights of proof against his estate and he is protected from suit the avoidance of preferences voluntary settlements and fraudulent dispositions of property by the bankrupt is intended to restore the property or money of the bankrupt to his estate to achieve a fair and rateable division of the bankrupts property among his creditors the bankrupt is disqualified from holding certain offices bankruptcy involves a change of status and quasipenal consequences upon discharge from bankruptcy the bankrupt is released form his debts subject to certain exceptions these considerations negate the existence of any policy underlying the act that a debtor should be made bankrupt if he is able to pay his debts but is unwilling to do so if a debtor is able to pay his debts but is recalcitrant his creditors may resort to the remedies otherwise afforded by the law such as execution against his property and garnishee proceedings the words able to pay his debts in s 522 of the act do not mean willing and able to do so emphasis added the parties are agreed that the bankruptcy should be brought to an end the only question being how that should be achieved by her motion ms cross seeks to have the sequestration order made by the registrar on 9 august 2004 set aside in opposing the motion the creditor and the trustee contend that the appropriate course is to make an order pursuant to s 153b1 of the act annulling the bankruptcy in a normal case annulment is undoubtedly the appropriate course but this is anything but a normal case the matter which evokes the response on the part of the trustee to oppose the motion is that in the case of annulment the trustee gets the benefit of s 1541b of the act namely he may apply the property of ms cross still vested in him the home unit at 1228 tullimbar road cronulla in payment of the costs charges and expenses of the administration of the bankruptcy including the remuneration and expenses of the trustee whereas if the sequestration order is set aside he has no such right of application the creditors opposition to the setting aside of the sequestration order is no doubt sourced in the consequential orders i would make of dismissing the petition and revoking the costs order made by the registrar on 9 august 2004 at the outset it may be said that there is no longer any third course for example rescission of the sequestration order see s 372 of the act vaucluse hospital pty ltd v phillips amp anor 2006 fmca 44 at 19 and 20 on the other hand reviews of registrars orders like appeals to the full court are outside the intended ambit of s 37 at the forefront of ms cross case is that she was bankrupted on the first return date of a creditors petition which was left with her while she was an involuntary patient in the psychiatric unit of sutherland hospital but which i have found was not properly served for a debt in respect of unpaid body corporate levies of 181358 increased to approximately 2400 by debt collection legal and court costs of obtaining a default judgment in respect thereof when on the evidence before me she owned assets in excess of half a million dollars including the home unit worth 375000 money on deposit with major banks of more than 130000 and shares and securities in major listed companies worth approximately 90000 moreover ms cross was not present when the sequestration order was made had she or representatives on her behalf been present on the day or if her circumstances and the circumstances of service of the creditors petition had been ventilated with the registrar on 9 august 2004 rather than being left buried in some affidavit of service i have no doubt that the sequestration order would not have been made mr bentley in his submissions said at this point i would just like to also make this quite clear that my friend made some submissions about what happened in front of registrar tesoriero but that affidavit of mr wellmeela clearly says that she was served in a psychiatric unit there is no hiding that the documentation which was presented to the court clearly stated the fact now i presented that petition but unfortunately so long ago i cant remember what was said i have a vague recollection that something may have been said about it but i cant recall and i am unable to assist the court or swear an affidavit so i havent but there is no doubt that it is quite clear in evidence from mr wellmeelas affidavit what happened where it happened and what was going on so it is not as if anyone has tried to conceal this from the court or from the registrar the fact is that mr bentley was the only person present before registrar tesoriero on 9 august 2004 he would not have been surprised at that he certainly did not expect ms cross to be present that he cannot remember what was said before the registrar on that day suggests to me that none of the relevant surrounding circumstances were brought to the registrars attention because he mr bentley was blinded by an obsession to ensure that whatever else happened registrar tesoriero made the sequestration order on that day as an officer of the court he had an overriding duty to do more to draw to the courts attention ms cross circumstances and the circumstances under which she was purportedly served with the creditors petition it is true that there has been some effluxion of time between the making of the sequestration order on 9 august 2004 and the filing of the motion on 7 november 2005 at least three things can be said about this maybe more first there is no time limitation in which to bring a motion to set aside an order after it has been entered where the order has been made in the absence of a party o35 r 72a of the fcr cf s 35a5 of the fca act and o 77 r 8 now repealed of the fcr second there is a dearth of evidence as to what occurred in the period from 9 august 2004 until april 2005 it seems that the trustee applied to become and became the registered proprietor of the home unit at cronulla on or about 19 october 2004 but otherwise there was no administration of the bankrupt estate the legal aid commission became aware of ms cross bankruptcy on or about 30 september 2004 nearly two months after she was made bankrupt but otherwise there is no evidence as to what happened if anything happened at all in addition to the matters mentioned during this period in all the circumstances i do not think this period should be counted as part of the effluxion of time third on the evidence before me the second period in the effluxion of time from 11 april 2005 until 7 november 2005 was taken up by the opc discovering the relevant evidence as to what took place obtaining legal advice thereon and on the basis of that advice deciding what action was to be taken in all the circumstances i do not find the second period so long as to militate against exercising my discretion to set aside the sequestration order rather than annul the bankruptcy in re daskalavski applicant ex parte the austral brick co pty ltd 1998 fca 782 emmett j in a short ex tempore judgment concluded that in circumstances where his honour was satisfied that the sequestration

one asset of ms cross her home unit at cronulla has been vested in the trustee and the debt on which she was bankrupted together with subsequent unpaid strata levies was paid out by the opc not the trustee following the protective commissioner being appointed the financial manager of ms cross financial affairs by order of the guardianship tribunal dated 11 april 2003 notwithstanding the trustees claim for remuneration to 3 june 2005 13990 and his anticipated claim for additional remuneration 5500 there was no evidence that the trustee had been actively involved in the administration of ms cross bankrupt estate conclusion when this choice as between an order that the sequestration order be set aside on the one hand and an order for annulment of the bankruptcy on the other has come before the courts on earlier occasions the courts have consistently stressed that a balance must be struck between the rights of the applicant who should never have been made bankrupt in the first place and the trustee who has simply done what the act requires him to do kyriackou v shield mercantile pty ltd no 2 2004 fca 1338 at 43 per weinberg j followed in capsalis v ozdemir 2005 fmca 1163 at

creditor have never been referred to as a relevant factor and understandably so this is not a case where the pendulum of balance tilts in favour of ms cross compare kyriackou as against the trustee on the contrary i have come to the firm conclusion that it would be totally unfair indeed a miscarriage of justice for ms cross to be saddled with any of the relatively considerable costs of the administration of her estate while that may involve the invocation of some injustice on the trustee in the circumstances of this case it seems it must be tolerated in the face of an inability of the court to order the petitioning creditor to bear such costs kyriackou at 39 per weinberg j for present purposes i am prepared to accept that as being the correct position however i do not think it is free from doubt the powers of the court under s 30 of the act are expressed in extremely wide terms in the circumstances of this case it seems unjust to me that the creditor only has to pay the costs of the motion even though it also loses the registrars order as to costs of the petition because of the conclusion i have come to as expressed in 116 supra i propose to exercise my discretion under o 35 r 7 of the fcr to set the sequestration order aside in the circumstances it is only appropriate that i summarise the matters i have taken into account in exercising my discretion to do so 1 the inappropriateness of bankruptcy proceedings as a debt collection remedy or mechanism such proceedings were never intended to operate against debtors who could but would not for whatever reason pay 2 the size of the debt originally less than 2000 3 the aggregate value free of encumbrances of ms cross assets closer to 600000 than 500000 approximately 200000 of which were in liquid form 4 the size of the actual and anticipated costs and expense of administering the estate in excess of 35000 when on the evidence there was minimal administration 5 the circumstances of ms cross mental condition and her admissions once involuntarily to the psychiatric unit of sutherland hospital during 2004 for a total of over three months 6 my finding that ms cross was not properly served with the creditors petition 7 the fact that she was not present or represented at the hearing at which the sequestration order was made 8 the fact that the circumstances referred to in 5 and those underlying my finding in 6 were not ventilated before the registrar on 9 august 2004 the first return date of the petition when the sequestration order was made 9 the fact that those involved in ensuring that ms cross was bankrupted on 9 august 2004 messrs meuller and bentley were officers of the court the orders of the court will be 1 michael gregory jones trustee of the bankrupt estate of isabell jean cross be joined

1108,70,40,315,8,14348,in summary the applicant submits that the aat misapplied the term own use or benefit within the context of s 81 in particular 8226 the phrase does not call for an assessment as to whether a person can in fact use the earnings as they wish or benefit from the earnings in an absolute sense 8226 the fact that the money may be earmarked to meet a particular obligation does not detract from the fact that the money is for the persons own use or benefit kear v secretary department of social security 1998 1087 fca 8226 the fact that the repayments were made in respect of tasks performed by the respondent and made to the same entity who paid her wages seems to have clouded the issue the situation is analogous to an employee who is found liable to the employer for damages for negligence arising out of the employees actions in the workplace even if the damages awarded were deducted from wages of the employee it could not be said that the employees earnings were the lesser sum after the deduction of the damages award 8226 the circumstances surrounding the payment by the respondent and later reimbursement of 1300 highlights the error in the aats approach 8226 the aat appears to have been influenced by the fact that the applicant was unable to identify a benefit to the respondent from the amounts of the shortfalls this is clearly an irrelevant consideration as the act provides for the alternative of use or benefit the respondent in this case clearly used the amounts to meet her obligations in any event the respondent did benefit from such amounts in that her superannuation entitlements were calculated on the basis of her gross earnings without deduction for the shortfalls as was apparent from the employee payment summary provided by her employer 14 in summary the respondent submitted 1 socalled questions of law 1 5 and 6 specified in the notice of appeal are not in fact questions of law 2 the aat correctly recognised that the key question is whether the whole of the respondents nominal gross wages can be said to be income as that term is defined for the purposes of s 8 of the act expressed alternatively could the amount of the withheld shortfall be said to be earned derived or received by her for her own use or benefit 3 the phrase for the persons own use or benefit entails the notion of a person being able to use property or income as the person wishes or sees fit as opposed to being obliged to apply the property or income in a particular way the respondent was never able at the time of earning derivation or constructive receipt to use the whole of her nominal gross wage as she wished or saw fit rather to the extent of any shortfall her employer was contractually entitled to withhold the amount of that shortfall from that gross wage and the respondent was obliged to accept that such an amount could be so withheld 4 the words without any reduction which appear in s 1072 of the act qualify only income as defined namely the income earned derived or received for the persons own use or benefit 5 reference by the applicant to the sum of 1300 later received by the respondent by way of refund from her employer is a distraction as the appeal is unconcerned with that sum although it will be relevant in any recalculation by the applicant of the amount if any of any overpayment of benefit in any event the aat correctly regarded that sum as ordinary income for the purposes of the act 15 appeals from the aat are not appeals in the strict sense as they lie within the original jurisdiction of the court a party to a proceeding before the aat may appeal to the court from any decision of the aat in that proceeding but only on questions of law s 441 administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 cth 47 it is for the same reason that i find distinguishable from these facts the decision in kear 1998 1087 fca where heerey j held that the relevant money received by the applicant in that case was his own money to deal with as he saw fit notwithstanding that the applicant had other commitments or arrangements for which that money was earmarked

24331,0,27,82,12,42538,the submissions made on behalf of the commissioner were to the following effect 1 there was no denial of procedural fairness by the tribunal for the following reasons a it was squarely put to mrs montgomery who had reconstructed the price spreadsheets that she had fabricated or massaged or fiddled the figures in the price spreadsheets b the tribunal in reviewing a decision is not bound by technicalities legal forms or rules of evidence and must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case in those circumstances the rule in browne v dunn has no application c the tribunal was entitled to look at the price spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions where it was obvious that information had been omitted or falsely inserted in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn d in relation to one subject matter 3d was invited by the tribunal during closing submissions to reopen its case and call further evidence it was clearly open to 3d to seek leave to recall mrs montgomery in order to overcome any perceived deficiency in the opportunity she had been afforded when first crossexamined to explain discrepancies in the relevant documents 3d did not seek such leave the substance of the fabrication was put to mrs montgomery 2 3d has submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness because it is alleged the specific detail of the commissioners analysis of the price spreadsheets which forms annexure a to the tribunals reasons for decision was not put to mrs montgomery the tribunal referred to this submission but found it to be without substance 3 from the commencement of the audit and in the hearing before the tribunal the commissioner had directly challenged the story put forward as to the existence of msh and mr borg it was manifest that any documentation put forward by the taxpayer in support of that story was also under challenge 4 the commissioners challenge to the price spreadsheets was also fully appreciated by 3d so much is clear from paras 14 and 15 of the submissions of the applicant dated 1 june 2007 which were provided to the tribunal before the commissioner made the submissions of which 3d presently complains 5 it is significant that notwithstanding the opportunity to do so in submissions in reply 3d made no submissions about the fabrications in the price spreadsheets but merely confined its complaint to what was said to be a denial of procedural fairness indeed 3d could not possibly have had an answer to the fabrications which were apparent on the face of the price spreadsheets when they were compared with the job balance record 6 in any event an evaluation of the price spreadsheets was not necessary to the tribunals decision once it found that mr borg did not exist the elaborate arrangements alleged as to how he was paid may be of limited relevance for that reason the tribunal took the view that the submissions made by the commissioner concerning the price spreadsheets were of peripheral relevance 7 it is clear that an immaterial error of law will not vitiate the decision of the tribunal even though it was perhaps not necessary to do so once it found that mr borg did not exist the tribunal for the sake of completeness annexed the commissioners analysis of the price spreadsheets to its reasons and held that it correctly summarised the evidence given in this regard 8 the evidence showed that mrs montgomery having prepared the price spreadsheets was the person who was most familiar with those documents and may be taken to have intimately known the content of them she must also be taken to have been aware that the figures in those documents had been manipulated in order to reach the totals on the cheques as the commissioner has demonstrated in annexure a to the tribunals reasons 9 it was also an incontrovertible fact that mrs montgomery had also managed to create a price spreadsheet in respect of items which proved not to be for hire at all but for sale demonstrating the fact of its fabrication mrs montgomery was crossexamined about this and it was directly put to her in the following terms really ms montgomery what this shows is that your documents at tab 14 are a fabrication arent theyno theyre not they came out of the computer program you have told us that the starting point of one of them the first one behind tab 14 for the week ending 28 december is a real document from the time havent youthats right its nothing of the kind is ityes it is its something that you have put together to try to substantiate numbersno i took it out of off the job balance generals and then you have told us that you have extrapolated back and lo and behold you have been able to extrapolate for the week ending 7 december by adding and subtracting advices and receipts to page 427 a number of 16500 which you purport would explain another entry in the bank statements and on mr borgs statements of accountthese were all these all came out of the computer program these being tab 14these were all worked out of the computer program they have been massaged the numbers have been massaged and fiddled withno and put together by you 10 clearly mrs montgomery as the author of the recreated price spreadsheets was only too aware of what the crossexaminer was putting to her when he suggested that she had massaged and fiddled the numbers if there was an answer to be made by her 3d was on notice of the need to elicit that explanation in reexamination or by seeking leave to adduce further evidence in chief application of the rule in browne v dunn 11 section 331b of the aat act stipulates that a proceeding before the tribunal shall be conducted with as little formality and technicality as the legislation and a proper consideration of the matters permits consistent with that legislative approach s 331c provides that the tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence 12 3d before the tribunal had suggested that there was a clear breach of the rule in browne v dunn in re ruddock in his capacity as minister for immigration and multicultural affairs and another ex parte applicant s1542002 2003 hca 60 2003 201 alr 437 the high court held that the rule in browne v dunn had no application to proceedings before the refugee review tribunal section 4202 of the migration act 1958 cth an equivalent provision to s 33 of the aat act was relevant to that conclusion the high court held that the purpose of such provisions was to free bodies such as the tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law 13 in any event even assuming the rule was to apply there was no breach of that rule where it is obvious that the evidence of the witness is challenged failure to state this expressly will not necessarily involve a breach of the rule 14 in jagelman v commissioner of taxation 96 atc 4055 it was submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness by reason of a failure to put a matter to the applicant justice hill observed at 4060 however it has been pointed out in a number of cases that the application of the rule in browne v dunn must depend upon the circumstances of the case where the issues in a case are such that it would readily be apparent to a party that a particular imputation has been made there will be no necessity to put that imputation to a witness who denies it and in consequence there will have been no denial of procedural fairness see seymour v australian broadcasting commission unreported court of appeal nsw 3 june 1977 discussed by hunt j in allied pastoral holdings pty ltd v fct 1983 1 nswlr 1 at 212 in the latter case hunt j said at 23 in many cases of course counsel for the party calling the witness in question will be alert to the relevance of the other material in the case to be relied upon for the challenge to the truth of the evidence given by his witness or to the credit of that witness and in those circumstances counsel will be able to give his witness the opportunity to deal with that other material in his own evidence in chief it was open to the tribunal to look at the price spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions 15 section 43 of the aat act provides that the tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred on the decisionmaker and stands in the shoes of the commissioner the tribunal is not bound by the facts that were before the decisionmaker 16 the price spreadsheets and the job balance general were 3ds documents and their inherent want of authenticity could be gathered directly from them 3ds written submissions in chief to the tribunal invited consideration of the content of the documents independent of any testimony about them from which 3d asserted that their authenticity was selfevident the commissioner was entitled to and did respond on the same basis it was open to the tribunal to draw the conclusions which the commissioner invited simply by looking at the documents in particular that there had been manipulation of those documents by either omitting or falsely inserting information in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn opportunity to reopen 17 section 39 of the aat act requires that the tribunal ensure that every party to a proceeding before the tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case this section is a statutory recognition of the requirement to afford natural justice section 331c has been held to permit the introduction of further evidence after the conclusion of the hearing that requirement may extend to permitting a party to adduce new evidence once judgement has been reserved it has been held that while normally a court will require exceptional circumstances to permit that course so stringent a test does not apply in aat hearings 18 in sullivan v department of transport 1978 20 alr 323 a party was afforded an opportunity by the tribunal to call further evidence justice deane said as follows in the context of the express invitation to the appellant at the conclusion of the evidence to adduce any further evidence or other material and of the complete absence of any indication by the appellant that he was under any misapprehension or that he desired that the proceedings be adjourned the failure of the tribunal either to adjourn the proceedings of its own motion or expressly to inform the appellant of his right to seek an adjournment did not in my view constitute a failure to ensure that the appellant was given a reasonable opportunity of putting his case or otherwise involve a failure to observe the requirements of natural justice 19 after the conclusion of the evidence and during the course of 3ds submissions below the tribunal indicated that it would afford 3d an opportunity to reopen its case if mr borg could be found the tribunal later repeated this invitation a number of times that 3d should go and find mr borg for the reason that he was either crucial or important in this equation 20 3d acknowledged that it was open to it to reopen its case it was open to 3d to have recalled mrs montgomery or any other witness it thought could shed light on the figures in the price spreadsheets the authenticity of which the commissioner had challenged first in crossexamination of mrs montgomery and subsequently in written submissions it did not do so for the obvious reason that there was no possible explanation for the discrepancies identified by the commissioner other than that the figures had been manipulated or fabricated 21 the tribunal amply accorded natural justice in the present case by extending an opportunity to 3d to call further evidence and by providing a further

not bound by technicalities legal forms or rules of evidence and b must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case the purpose of a provision such as s 4202 is to free bodies such

4084,85,16,182,117,46541,the tribunal then proceeded to consider whether the proceedings before buddin j could be described as having resulted in a conviction for a criminal offence it referred to a

industry employees union v mudginberri pty limited 1986 hca 46 1986 161 clr 98 the tribunal concluded that there was no doubt that proceedings before buddin j had been brought with the purpose of punishing mr seymour noting that it had been common ground as buddin j recorded in his reasons that the provisions of the crimes sentencing procedure act 1999 nsw applied and that the penalty imposed had been one of imprisonment for a fixed term as opposed to an indefinite term until the contempt of being purged the tribunal then said 24 therefore whilst not free from doubt i accept for current purposes that the contempt proceedings before buddin j were criminal 25 the result of that finding has application to both subparagraphs 52 and 54 of the respondents statement of facts and contentions 31 mr seymour relied upon the statement that all proceedings for contempt must realistically be seen as criminal in nature as deane j pointed out in hinch v attorney general vict 1987 hca 56 1987 164 clr 15 at 49 and as approved by brennan deane toohey and gaudron jj in witham v holloway 1995 hca 3 1995 183 clr 525 at 534 it was said that accordingly the tribunals finding that the contempt charge determined by buddin j was criminal was an error of law next he argued that that error of law affected the tribunals finding that mr seymour demonstrated a lack of candour and openness by his apparently contradictory stances taken before the court of appeal in the earlier contempt proceedings namely that the law society should not be allowed to appeal against his acquittal and his stance in the proceedings before the tribunal that the proceedings before buddin j were not criminal 34 the authority submitted that the tribunal was correct to classify the proceedings before buddin j as having involved a conviction of a criminal offence by reference to the character of the jurisdiction invoked under pt 55 rr 7 and 13 of the supreme court rules the fact that the proceedings were to seek the punishment by imprisonment of mr seymour and the nature of the inherent jurisdiction to punish for contempt the authority submitted that the character of the contempt charged before buddin j was that of disobedience in the sense of a defiance of the authority of the supreme court and that there was a public injury occasioned by such defiance it was said that the purpose of the proceedings was to maintain the integrity of the judicial process to advance the public interest to vindicate judicial authority or to maintain the integrity of the judicial process relying on that class of contempt as being within a class of criminal contempt as explained in witham v holloway 1995 183 clr at 531 73 in witham v holloway 1995 hca 3 1995 183 clr 525 all justices considered the historical classification of contempts as civil and criminal to be unsatisfactory brennan deane toohey and gaudron jj described the differences upon which the distinction of classification is based as being in many respects illusory 183 clr at 534 while mchugh j said the case for abolishing the distinction is a strong one 183 clr at 549 75 the reliance on the distinction in a case like the present where the applicant was sentenced to nine months imprisonment suspended for breaching a court order shows how unworkable the distinction really is in practice was the contempt with which the applicant was charged civil when the charge was preferred did it remain so or did it transmute as the seriousness of and contumaciousness of his conduct was proved in evidence or found by buddin j when giving judgment the very notion that an allegation of contempt can have such a chameleonlike character demonstrated in australasian meat industry employees union v mudginberri station pty ltd 1986 hca 46 1986 161 clr 98 at 108109 and in witham v holloway 1995 hca 3 1995 183 clr 525 that all such cases had to be decided on the criminal standard of proof the high court did not have to decide in the latter case whether the distinction between civil and criminal contempt should be abolished see 183 clr at 549 76 in witham v holloway 1995 hca 3 1995 183 clr 525 at 534 brennan deane toohey and gaudron jj said that because of the illusory nature of the differences said to exist between the civil and criminal classes of contempt and the fact that the usual outcome of all such proceedings is punishment all proceedings for contempt must realistically be seen as criminal in nature 77 that does not result in all contempt proceedings themselves being now seen to be for a criminal offence indeed their honours went on to say 183 clr at 534 however to say that proceedings for contempt are essentially criminal in nature is not to equate them with the trial of a criminal charge there are clear procedural differences the most obvious being that criminal charges ordinarily involve trial by jury whereas charges of contempt do not there is no basis in our view for importing into the law of contempt the nineteenth century rules which allowed a verdict of guilty given in a jury trial to be quashed on appeal but did not permit of an order for retrial moreover the issue so far as contempt is concerned is not whether there should be a retrial but whether there should be a rehearing 84 the elusiveness of the distinction windeyer j identified is demonstrated by the result in witham v holloway 1995 hca 3 1995 183 clr 525 there the question was what standard of proof applied ie civil or criminal in proceedings which fell squarely within lord atkinsons civil classification namely charges of contempt that the appellant knowingly or recklessly presented a false or misleading statement of his assets and liabilities in an affidavit which he had been ordered to make and that he breached what was then termed a mareva injunction this is now known as a mareva order cardile v led builders pty ltd 1999 hca 18 1999 198 clr 380 at 393394 25 26 by dealing with his assets contrary to the terms brennan deane toohey and gaudron jj said 183 clr at 533534 given that purpose or object cannot readily be disentangled from effect and given also that a penal or disciplinary jurisdiction may be called into play in proceedings alleging breach of an order or undertaking it is necessary to acknowledge as it was in mudginberri 1986 1986 hca 46 161 clr 98 at 108 that punitive and remedial objects are in the words of salmon lj inextricably intermixed jennison v baker 1972 2 qb 52 at 64 moreover and perhaps of more importance nothing is achieved by describing some proceedings as punitive and others as remedial or coercive punishment is punishment whether it is imposed in vindication or for remedial or coercive purposes and there can be no doubt that imprisonment and the imposition of fines the usual sanctions for contempt constitute punishment and the same is true of a sequestration made in consequence of a companys failure to comply with an order or undertaking 98 when the high court held in witham v holloway 1995 hca 3 1995 183 clr 525 at 534 that all contempts are criminal in nature and must be proved on the criminal standard it ensured that the alleged contemnor was afforded the safeguards given at common law to all accuseds the court also recognized that the historical classification of civil and criminal contempt is unsatisfactory 104 accordingly i must decide whether mr seymour was found by buddin j to have acted contumaciously in breach of the injunction a civil contempt can become criminal where the act charged is contumacious in the sense that in doing it there was a direct intention to disobey the order witham v holloway 1995 hca 3 1995 183 clr 525 at 541 per mchugh j citing warrington js well known dictum in stancomb v trowbridge urban council

assess the totality of the evidence to determine whether the land council has established on the balance of probabilities that native title does not exist worimi has identified a number of different groups at various stages of these proceedings that he says hold native title in the land including himself and his immediate family and all worimi people he must also provide evidence that addresses at the least the land councils evidence that there is no native title within the principles set down in yorta yorta that there is no normative body of laws and customs in connection with the land the observance of which has been substantially maintained from the time of sovereignty to the present day worimi does not need to prove each element of native title he is not obliged to establish native title as if it were a positive defence being asserted he does however need to address native title under the act by reference to those material matters he must address the necessary elements sufficiently to cast doubt on the land councils assertion of no native title he needs to show that there have existed traditional laws and customs in relation to the land the continued observance of those laws and customs and the maintenance of a connection with the land if he does not lead evidence as to each of those matters elements of native title he will need to adduce evidence sufficient in scope and weight as to one or more of those elements to cast doubt on the proposition that native title does not exist 56 worimi contends that the evidence required to discharge the land councils onus of proof may not be achieved without strict proof of historical and anthropological facts through use of widely accepted authoritative writings and expert evidence and involves consideration of the historical archaeological linguistic and anthropological evidence in the light of the direct testimony of aboriginal witnesses worimi says that in determining the question of the existence or nonexistence of native title on the balance of probabilities regard should be had to the ability of the parties to adduce evidence by this he seems to be saying that the court should give more weight to his evidence and discount the evidence of the land council if he is i do not accept it 64 based on the presumption that native title exists over the land worimi contends that 8226 it is common ground that lot 576 falls within traditional worimi country 8226 the land council must prove that any connection which aboriginal people may have had with the land under traditional laws and customs has not been maintained 8226 in order to succeed the land council must establish that traditional law and custom has ceased to be observed anywhere in worimi country 8226 it is incumbent upon the land council to adduce evidence from worimi people positively to assert that no laws and customs have been passed down to them by their forebears and additionally there needs to be expert evidence that there were a set of normative rules traditionally adopted and followed and observed by the worimi people 8226 following yorta yorta the land council must prove that preexisting laws and customs have been substantially interrupted from what they were at sovereignty or no longer exist at all 8226 there must be evidence of the cessation of the acknowledgement of laws and observance of customs sufficient to show that those laws and customs have been abandoned by the whole of worimi society 65 worimi submits that the evidence supports the inference that there was a group of worimi people and a society of aboriginal people who inhabited the area around port stephens at the time of sovereignty for the purposes of this application i accept that to be the case 66 worimi submits that once this is accepted it follows that this group had some form of normative rules which regulated their society and that once this is accepted it follows as a matter of logic and reason that bearing in mind the burden of proof the land council is required to lead sufficient evidence i of the nature and existence of presovereign native title rights and interests and ii to the effect that these presovereign rights and interests are no longer observed before the court may infer the nonexistence of native title over lot 576 72 in mason v tritton 1994 34 nswlr 572 kirby p pointed to the difficulty for aboriginal people to provide recorded details of for example genealogy at 586 589 his honour discussed the inferences that can be drawn to overcome the absence of evidence for the period from 1788 to a later time in that case to the 1880s referring to the analysis in wigmore on evidence vol 2 3 rd edition at 437 his honour said that it is not appropriate to apply a presumption of continuance but a process of inference his honour was prepared to draw an inference from proved use of land in the 1880s back to the time before 1788 as he noted it is more easily drawn in more traditional aboriginal communities however in mason there were other aspects of the claim to native title which were not proved further it is hard to see from yorta yorta how a presumption of native title can be said to apply 134 the land council seeks a determination of the absence of native title that means native title under the act in yorta yorta the high court emphasised that native title under the act must be understood in accordance with the definition in s 2231 of the act that section provides 1 the expression native title or native title rights and interests means the communal group or individual rights and interests of aboriginal peoples or torres strait islanders in relation to land or waters where a the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the aboriginal peoples or torres strait islanders and b the aboriginal peoples or torres strait islanders by those laws and customs have a connection with the land or waters and c the rights and interests are recognised by the common law of australia 135 in yorta yorta at 31 gleeson cj gummow and hayne jj raised the importance of identifying whether the body of traditional law and custom that intersects with the common law for the purposes of s 2231 of the act is that as existing at the time of sovereignty or that existing today but connected with a body of law and custom that existed at sovereignty their honours reiterated what had been said in fejo v northern territory 1998 hca 58 1998 195 clr 96 native title with its origin in the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous people who possess the native title is recognised by the common law their honours went on to state that an application for determination of native title requires the location of that intersection between native title and the common law and it requires that it be located by reference to the act in particular it must be located by reference to the definition of native title in s 2231 a determination of the existence of native title is a creature of the act yorta yorta at 32 so too is a determination of the absence of native title 136 a number of principles relevant to the present case were set out in yorta yorta 8226 laws or customs in which native title rights or interests find their origins must be laws or customs having a normative content and deriving therefore from a body of norms or normative system that existed before sovereignty at 38 8226 observable patterns of behaviour may not amount to rights or interests in relation to land or waters under the act at 42 8226 upon the crown acquiring sovereignty the normative or lawmaking system which then existed could not thereafter validly create new rights duties or interests rights or interests in land created after sovereignty and which owed their origin and continued existence only to a normative system other than that of the new sovereign power are not given effect at 43 and 44 8226 this does not prevent the transmission of rights and interests under traditional laws and traditional customs which existed at sovereignty nor does it prevent any alteration to or development of that traditional law and custom after sovereignty account may at least be taken of developments of a kind contemplated by that traditional law and custom at 44 8226 traditional law or custom is apt to refer to a means of transmission of law or custom in the context of the act the term traditional conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions however in the context of the act traditional laws and customs equate to the normative rules that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the british crown at 46 it follows that the mere use of the word traditional does not establish the normative rules necessary for the establishment of native title under the act 8226 the normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed namely the traditional laws acknowledged and customs observed must have had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty if that normative system has not existed throughout that period the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist importantly any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not reconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which right and interest must spring if they are to fall within the definition of native title at 47 8226 if the society out of which the body of laws and customs arises ceases to exist as a group which acknowledges and observes those laws and customs the laws and customs cease to have continued existence and vitality at 50 137 the land council relies not only upon the absence of any claimant application over the land but also on the evidence from aboriginal people associated with the area who have confirmed that in their view the native title rights and interests that worimi asserts do not exist the land council has established that no aboriginal person other than worimi and some of his immediate family who supported his claimant applications asserts that native title exists in relation to lot 576 all of the aboriginal witnesses called by the land council identified as worimi people all are aware of the assertions made by worimi concerning the existence of native title in the land and gave evidence generally rejecting those assertions some of those witnesses were parties to claimant applications for a determination of the existence of native title in respect of land in the port stephens area but none of the witnesses have filed native title claimant applications in relation to the land or land in the immediate vicinity of lot 576 153 worimi says that his family and his mother before him were removed by actions of others and that the removal was not voluntary in an area where nonaboriginal communities developed many aboriginal families lived at karuah which is also part of worimi land in deciding whether claimants by traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed have a present connection with land some interruptions to enjoyment of native title rights and interests is allowed gale at 108 citing yorta yorta and de rose 163 as in yorta yorta if there had been a womens site on or near the land and kingsley beach much has changed since it was used 164 this baptism of worimis grandson by his daughter beryl and wife cynthia represents an attempt by worimi to restore what he says his grandmother told him as amended by his wifes practices it does not represent continuity worimi has claimed that the site is sacred to all worimi women no woman has supported this claim apart from some members of his immediate family who supported his claimant applications 165 in gale madgwick j was dealing with a native title claimant application from which the claimants withdrew one of the respondents deerubbin local aboriginal land council sought an order that there was no native title over the subject land expert evidence had been filed in support of the claimant applications to which the deerubbin local aboriginal land council had responded his honour considered yorta yorta and drew from it a number of relevant principles including 8226 n ative title rights and interests derive from traditional laws and customs in the sense that they survived the acquisition of sovereignty over australia yorta yorta at 75 8226 the rights and interests must be presently possessed under traditional laws and customs this requires that the normative system under which those rights or interests are possessed be a system that has had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty yorta yorta at 47 8226 some change to or adaptation of traditional law or custom or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights or interests since sovereignty will not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim 8226 the statutory questions in s 223 are directed to the present possession of the rights or interests not their exercise and to the existence of a relevant present connection it follows that the nonexercise of native title rights or interests by some of the persons now claiming such rights or interests will not inevitably be fatal 8226 the requirement in s 2231b for connection with land or waters by traditional laws and customs must be a connection which the peoples concerned have by their traditional laws and customs that is the laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the ancestors of the claimants at the time of sovereignty it is the normative quality of the normative rules which rendered the crowns radical title acquired at sovereignty subject to the rights and interests then existing and which are now identified as native title 8226 it is an important qualification that the acknowledgment and observance of those rules need only have continued substantially and not entirely uninterrupted 8226 nonetheless it is necessary to demonstrate that it is the normative system of the presovereign society out of which the claimed rights and interests arise this entails that it be shown that that society has continued to exist as a body united by its acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs 8226 acknowledgement and observance of those laws and customs must have continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty it is not enough that there be a body of laws and customs originating in the common acceptance by or agreement of a new society of indigenous peoples to acknowledge and observe them notwithstanding that they are similar to or even identical with those of an earlier and different society 167 the positive assertion of native title rights and interests requires more than vague assertions of membership of a group of people and of custodianship of land worimis facts and contentions comprehensively fail to establish the elements of native title required by s 223 of the act they do not establish native title within the meaning of yorta yorta they do not identify the alleged content of the normative body of laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the presovereignty society nor how those laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted while worimi is not required positively to establish native title in order to resist the land councils application he must present evidence which is sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements that the evidence does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist 169 as the high court said in yorta yorta the relevant laws and customs must be rules having normative content without that quality there may be observable patterns of behaviour but not rights or interests in relation to land or waters rights or interests created after sovereignty are insufficient although there may be changes in the traditional laws and customs at least to the extent that such changes and developments were contemplated by traditional laws and customs 170 as was said in yorta yorta at 47 and repeated in bodney at 47 if the normative system has not existed throughout the period since sovereignty the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist the law and custom arise out of and go to define a particular society a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs yorta yorta at 49 bodney at 46 unless a society has and acknowledges and observes laws and customs under which native title rights and interests are possessed there can be no native title rights whether communal group or individual bodney at 157 it is therefore necessary for a person claiming native title to show that the normative system that existed at sovereignty is substantially the same as the one that exists today bodney at 47 this must be established for each generation to establish that the laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted bodney at 70 74 184 it follows from yorta yorta at 51 56 that native title if it existed presovereignty ceases to exist for the purposes of the act if the society being the worimi people the maiaangal clan or the garuahgal clan ceased to acknowledge and observe the laws and customs that worimi describes the rights and interests to which those laws and customs give rise are not possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed they ceased to exist and the later adoption of the laws and customs does not give rise to rights and interests rooted in presovereignty traditional law and custom 185 the changes in worimis description of the persons who he says observe or observed the traditional laws and customs in respect of the land have not assisted in the analysis of the evidence as set out in worimi 2007 and worimi 2006 he has changed the identification of the persons said to be relevant as to the identification of family members in the claim group worimi has included variously apart from himself his wife and children all his sisters and their daughters and his mother he was not consistent in his evidence asserting that he was bringing the claim on behalf of the garuahgal women his family and all worimi people irrespective of the group said to hold native title over the land the requirements of s 223 of the act are not satisfied while worimi was not required to establish native title in accordance with s 223 of the act in order to resist the land councils application given the time available to worimi since these proceedings were commenced he has had ample opportunity to formulate his contentions with reference to s 223 of the act in order to cast sufficient doubt on the land councils case 186 the evidence is that the observance of the traditional laws and customs ceased so far as a womens site on the land is concerned the evidence is not of adaptation of traditional laws and customs but of substantial interruption amounting to cessation of observance

14560,23,31,372,200,3474,kind of waiver that is in issue in this case is commonly referred to as imputed or implied waiver the former expression is preferable as it reflects the way in which the high court expressed the governing legal principles in mann v carnell 1999 hca 66 1999 201 clr 1 mann in mann at 13 29 gleeson cj gaudron gummow and callinan jj said waiver may be express or implied disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect when an affirmative answer is given to such a question it is sometimes said that waiver is imputed by operation of law this means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege thus in benecke v national australia bank the client was held to have waived privilege by giving evidence in legal proceedings concerning her instructions to a barrister in related proceedings even though she apparently believed she could prevent the barrister from giving the barristers version of those instructions she did not subjectively intend to abandon the privilege she may not even have turned her mind to the question however her intentional act was inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of the communication what brings about the waiver is the inconsistency which the courts where necessary informed by considerations of fairness perceive between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large the concluding part of this passage draws attention to the fact that the test for imputed waiver had previously been expressed in terms of fairness see attorneygeneral nt v maurice 1986 hca 80 1986 161 clr 475 maurice at 481 per gibbs cj 487 488 per mason and brennan jj 492 493 per deane j and 497 498 per dawson j under the test propounded in mann it is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect which effects a waiver of the privilege fairness has become a subsidiary consideration it may be relevant to the courts assessment of inconsistency in some contexts but not in others in commissioner of taxation v rio tinto limited 2006 fcafc 86 rio tinto at 44 the full court kenny stone and edmonds jj said that there was a good deal of doubt whether the language used by the majority in mann worked any real change in the principle which governs imputed waiver this observation was made somewhat tentatively and was not material to the courts decision my own view is that a test expressed in terms of inconsistency more readily accommodates the variety of situations in which questions of imputed waiver can arise than a test expressed in terms of fairness the criterion of fairness is readily understandable in the context of inter partes litigation but it is difficult to apply sensibly in other contexts see the observations by mchugh j in mann at 40 128 and toohey j in goldberg v ng 1995 hca 39 1995 185 clr 83 goldberg v ng at 110 awb submitted that this court should hold that there has been no imputed waiver because the commonwealth has made no attempt to identify why it would be unfair or inequitable for awb to maintain privilege in the underlying investigations this submission immediately raises the question unfair or inequitable to whom i doubt that any question arises of fairness to the commission it is an arm of the executive government charged with the investigation of specified matters nor does any question arise of fairness to the commonwealth fairness presupposes a balancing of interests between parties who are in dispute in that context partial disclosures raise a question of fairness because there is the capacity to mislead one party to the dispute to his or her detriment these concepts do not translate easily to the present case cf mchugh j in mann at 40 127128 there is also the difficulty that outside the framework of an inter partes dispute fairness is truly a term of indeterminate reference mann at 40 129 per mchugh j citing rj desiatnik legal professional privilege in australia 1999 p 122 133 mann anticipated that there will be cases in which considerations of fairness have little or no role to play this is such a case the broad question posed by mann is whether and to what extent awbs disclosures are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the documents which are at issue in these proceedings this question wraps up several subsidiary issues in particular whether awbs disclosures involved on each occasion a disclosure of the gist or substance of its legal advice whether awb consciously deployed that advice so as to advance its own commercial or other interests and if so whether that disclosure has resulted in an imputed waiver of privilege over any and what associated materials in any application of mann the starting point must be an analysis of the disclosures or other acts or omissions of the party claiming privilege that are said to be inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the privileged material see rio tinto at 45 the disclosures in question here were made variously to the iic to the australian government to the commission and in some instances via the procedures of the commission to the public at large in my opinion there is no reason why these disclosures cannot support a finding that awb has waived legal professional privilege over associated material awb submitted that imputed waiver cannot arise in the context of a commission established under the rca alternatively it submitted that the coercive and inquisitorial context in which the alleged waiver has taken place is an important factor which strongly militates against waiver these submissions ignore the voluntary disclosures that awb made to the australian government in any event i am not persuaded that awbs disclosures to the commission and the iic are incapable of giving rise to an imputed waiver leaving aside any question of waiver awb was entitled to maintain legal professional privilege in the course of proceedings before the commission and by and large it sought to do so to the extent that awb has already produced documents to the commission containing legal advice or instructions it did so because it recognised that actions it had taken outside the commission had the consequence of waiving privilege over those documents as for the oral evidence that the commonwealth now relies upon lindberg cooper and scales were senior executives of awb when they gave that evidence to the commission there is nothing before me to suggest that they were not speaking as executives of awb when they gave their evidence or that their evidence fell outside the scope of their authority from awb further their evidence was given in the presence of awbs legal representatives without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege lindberg cooper and scales may have been compelled to give evidence at the commission but they were under no compulsion to reveal the gist or substance of legal advice that had been obtained by awb in these circumstances i infer that the relevant evidence given by lindberg cooper and scales was given with the authority or acquiescence of awb i also infer that awb was content for the evidence to be given at public hearings of the commission having regard to its own commercial interests the evidence before me makes it clear that awb was concerned to defend its integrity and commercial reputation in the course of the commissions hearings i infer that awb made the assessment that it would advance its commercial interests if it were to be known publicly that it had undertaken extensive legal reviews and that as a result it had obtained legal advice that there was no evidence that it had engaged in any improper or unlawful conduct in breach of the united nations sanctions awb was content for information of this character to be disclosed publicly in relation to both project rose and project water it would of course be a different case if the documents and information that the commonwealth relies upon were disclosed under legal compulsion on any view the fact that documents and information were disclosed under compulsion would be very relevant to the question whether the person claiming privilege had engaged in inconsistent conduct there is moreover authority to the effect that a production of documents or evidence under compulsion will not result in any waiver of privilege goldman v hesper 1988 1 wlr 1238 goldman trans america computer co inc v ibm corporation 573 f2d 646 9 th cir 1978 trans america at 651 awbs disclosures to the iic were not made under legal compulsion they were made by choice under a confidentiality regime negotiated by awb the memorandum of understanding between awb and the iic provided that awb could withhold documents from the iic on grounds of commercial sensitivity or legal professional privilege or if there was a risk that awb its officers or employees would be exposed to breaches of australian law it also provided that any interviews conducted by the iic of awb officers or employees could be undertaken in the presence of a personal legal counsel andor up to two representatives of awb awb thereby retained the right to object to any question that intruded into areas protected by legal professional privilege on the evidence before me including in particular the various briefings which hargreaves gave to the australian government it is clear that awb decided that it needed to cooperate and be seen to cooperate with the iic so as to retain the support of the australian government and to protect and defend its commercial reputation i do not agree with awbs submission that even if its disclosures were not compelled by law the inquisitorial context in which they took place is a factor which strongly militates against waiver in australia legal professional privilege is a fundamental common law right that can be asserted outside the context of adversarial litigation it can for instance be invoked to resist the production of documents in answer to a search warrant or the giving of information or the production of documents pursuant to coercive statutory powers or notices daniels at 552553 9 11 and 563 44 baker v campbell 1983 hca 39 1983 153 clr 52 as legal professional privilege can be invoked outside the context of judicial or quasijudicial proceedings logic suggests that it should be capable of being waived if the claimant engages in conduct that is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect it should not matter whether the conduct takes place within or outside the framework of the proceedings or investigatory process in which a demand has been made for the production of privileged documents or information the crucial question is whether the conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality the disclosure of privileged communications to a third party can result in an imputed waiver of privilege even if there is no intention of waiving privilege and the disclosure is for a limited and specific purpose in mann the chief minister of the australian capital territory conveyed legal advice on a confidential basis to a member of the territorys legislative assembly to enable him to consider the reasonableness of the governments decision to settle certain legal proceedings the majority decision turned on the fact that the disclosure to a member of the legislative assembly was not regarded as disclosure to a third party in their joint judgment gleeson cj gaudron gummow and callinan jj said at 15 35 that the purpose of the privilege being to protect the territory from subsequent disclosure of the legal advice it received concerning the litigation instituted by the appellant there was nothing inconsistent with that purpose in the chief minister conveying the terms of that advice on a confidential basis to a member of the legislative assembly who wished to consider the reasonableness of the conduct of the territory in relation to the litigation however their honours also observed that while the voluntary disclosure of privileged legal advice to a third party will not necessarily waive privilege it can do so they said that goldberg v ng illustrates that depending on the circumstances the disclosure of a privileged communication to a third party for a limited and specific purpose and on terms as to confidentiality can have the consequence of waiving privilege mchugh j dissented in his view any disclosure of privileged material to a third party who is a stranger to the privileged relationship ie to a person who is not the lawyer or the client should have the consequence that privilege in that material is waived as against the world at 34 108 3738 118 42 133134 as i read his honours judgment the key reason why his honour preferred a bright line rule of this kind is that it would ensure that legal professional privilege was not extended beyond the rationales that support it at 37 117118 ensuring candid communications between a lawyer and a client is unlikely to be endangered if a privilege holder is held to waive privilege because he or she has voluntarily disclosed the communication to a stranger whether the communication will be disclosed in the future to a stranger to the privilege is entirely within the control of the client at that stage the client will determine whether his or her interests are best served by retaining the privilege or disclosing the communication but it is difficult to see how the possibility of voluntary disclosure will prevent the client being candid with his or her lawyer a client who voluntarily discloses privileged information to a stranger to the privileged relationship has made a choice based no doubt on considerations personal to him or her that the purpose for which the communication is disclosed to the stranger is more important than protecting the absolute confidentiality of the communication by preventing the stranger from having knowledge of it the person may be encouraged to do so as in goldberg v ng by an expectation that the stranger will not further disclose the communication but in my opinion if privileged material is voluntarily disclosed to a stranger to the privileged relationship the fact that it may be received under an obligation of confidence should not be relevant to whether privileged is waived on the facts mchugh j considered that disclosure to a member of the legislative assembly who was not a member of the executive government was relevantly a disclosure to a stranger to the privileged relationship at 44 139 in goldberg v ng the respondents sued their solicitor goldberg for failure to account for monies received and disbursed by him as their solicitor they also made a professional conduct complaint against him to the law society of new south wales in answer to the complaint goldberg prepared statements with annexures that included a draft brief to counsel and submitted them to the societys professional conduct department in doing so goldberg told the society that the statements and the annexures were confidential and he wished to retain his legal professional privilege in them the society dismissed the complaint on the ground that there was no evidence of professional misconduct or unsatisfactory professional conduct subsequently in the course of the supreme court proceedings instituted by the respondents against goldberg the respondents served a subpoena on the society requiring it to produce documents relating to the complaint against goldberg all of the members of the high court held that there had been no express or intentional waiver by goldberg of his legal professional privilege in the statements and annexures the issue that divided the court was whether waiver should be imputed by operation of law deane dawson and gaudron jj held at 100102 that it should because the professional complaint and the supreme court proceedings were but different emanations of the one dispute and goldbergs provision of the statements to the society was voluntary and for the calculated purpose of demonstrating the reliability of his denial of the alleged failure to account their honours analysed the issue in terms of fairness but they could equally and perhaps more appropriately have done so in terms of inconsistency toohey and gummow jj dissented in separate judgments each expressed the view that waiver should not be imputed because the disclosures by goldberg were made to a third party for a limited and specific purpose toohey j said at 110 that the following factors militated strongly against any implied or imputed waiver first goldberg disclosed material to the society because of a complaint against him on an undertaking by the society that the contents would be kept confidential secondly the disclosure was made in the context of the societys investigation of a complaint in pursuance of its statutory powers and consequently it could be regarded as having been made for the purposes of the act and thirdly the disclosure was confined to the society gummow j said at 123 that as the disclosures were made in the context of compulsory statutory processes the circumstances of the case supplied no sufficient reason for depriving goldberg of privilege even allowing for the advantage he sought to gain by making the disclosure the case of restom v battenberg 2006 fca 781 provides an example of a case where disclosures to a third party triggered a waiver of legal professional privilege in the course of bankruptcy proceedings the debtor claimed privilege over a letter that passed between his australian and scottish solicitors stone j held that the disclosure of the contents of the letter to the scottish employment tribunal was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the letter and constituted a waiver of privilege in network ten ltd v capital television holdings ltd 1995 36 nswlr 275 which predated goldberg v ng and mann giles j held that a limited and specific disclosure of privileged material on terms of confidentiality did not result in a loss of privilege in australian rugby union ltd v hospitality group pty ltd 1999 165 alr 253 sackville j said that it follows from goldberg v ng that the disclosure of a privileged communication for a limited purpose and subject to a confidentiality requirement may or may not amount to a waiver of privilege depending on the circumstances of the case at 262263 4243 on the facts of that case sackville j held that a disclosure of legal advice to the solicitors and representatives of two other companies on strict terms as to confidentiality and for the purpose of those other companies obtaining legal advice did not result in an imputed waiver his honour distinguished goldberg v ng as a case in which the disclosure was made to gain an advantage over the opposing party in related litigation at 263 45 there are several english cases in which disclosure to a third party for a limited and specific purpose has not resulted in a loss of privilege british coal corporation v dennis rye ltd no 2 1988 1 wlr 1113 british coal goldman and gotha city v southebys no 1 1988 1 wlr 1114 in british coal neill lj with whom stocker lj and dillon lj agreed held that the disclosure of documents by the plaintiff to the police to assist in a criminal investigation and criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege neill lj said at 822 in my judgment the action of the plaintiff in making documents available for the purpose of the criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege to which it was entitled in the present civil proceedings its action in regard to both the category a and the category b documents was in accordance with its duty to assist in the conduct of the criminal proceedings and could not properly be construed as an express or implied waiver of its rights in its own civil litigation indeed it would in my view be contrary to public policy if the plaintiffs action in making the documents available in the criminal proceedings had the effect of automatically removing the cloak of privilege which would otherwise be available to them in the civil litigation for which the cloak was designed in goldman the court of appeal considered the effect of a statutory requirement that a claimant for costs must disclose privileged materials to the courts taxing officers taylor lj with whom woolf lj and lord donaldson mr agreed said that once a party puts forward privileged documents as part of his case for costs the privilege is relaxed temporarily and pro hac vice if the taxing officers felt compelled by natural justice considerations to disclose part or all of the contents of a privileged document to the opposite party that disclosure would be for the purposes of the taxation only and would not amount to a waiver that prevented the owner of the document from reasserting privilege in any subsequent context at 102 mchugh j took a stricter view in giannarelli v wraith no 2 1991 hca 2 1991 171 clr 592 his honour noted that in victoria unlike in england a litigant can refuse to produce documents to the taxing master on the grounds of legal professional privilege however mchugh j said that if the litigant choses to produce privileged documents to the taxing master then the litigant will be taken to have waived privilege and must let the opposing parties see the documents his honour did not countenance any middle course under which privilege could be waived solely for the purposes of the taxation and then reasserted in some other context at 607 the general rule adopted in the united states is that any voluntary disclosure of privileged communications by a client to a third party breaches the confidentiality of the attorneyclient relationship and therefore waives the privilege not only as to the specific communication disclosed but as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter see weil v investmentindicators research and management inc 647 f2d 18 9 th cir 1981 at 24

in extrajudicial disclosure situations 1988 university of illinois law review 999 the us courts have also considered whether a disclosure of privileged material to government investigators will have the consequence of waiving privilege in re sealed case the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia considered whether a corporation that had submitted its own investigating counsels report into alleged bribes and improper payments to the internal revenue service and the securities and exchange commission sec pursuant to voluntary disclosure programs had thereby impliedly waived its privilege over documents which were clearly identified in the report the court held that by revealing part of privileged communications to the agencies to gain a commercial advantage the corporation had made a disclosure which was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality accordingly the court held that the corporation had waived privilege as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter the principle applied by the court was that at 818 29 courts need not allow a claim of privilege when the party claiming the privilege seeks to use it in a way that is not consistent with the purpose of the privilege thus since the purpose of the attorneyclient privilege is to protect the confidentiality of attorneyclient communications in order to foster candor within the attorneyclient relationship voluntary breach of confidence or selective disclosure for tactical purposes waives the privilege disclosure is inconsistent with confidentiality and courts need not permit hideandseek manipulation of confidences in order to foster candor the court rejected an argument that waiver should not be imputed because the corporation had disclosed the investigating counsels report for specific and limited purposes only in doing so it declined to follow the decision in diversified industries inc v meredith 572 f2d 596 8 th cir 1977 diversified industries at 611 in which the eighth circuit court of appeals held that disclosures to the sec under a voluntary disclosure program did not constitute a waiver to anyone but the sec it noted that the decision in diversified industries was rejected in permian corp v united states 665 f2d 1215 dc cir 1981 at 12201222 on the ground that it unnecessarily expanded the scope of attorneyclient privilege see also in

obtained as a result of project rose or project water it contended that these disclosures did no more than refer to the existence of legal advice without disclosing its substance alternatively awb argued that the record of lindbergs interview with the iic and the evidence given to the commission by lindberg cooper and scales cannot be related to any particular piece of legal advice other than that provided by mr tracey qc the applicable principles are set out in my decision in awb v cole at 135 139 the authorities draw a distinction between a mere reference to the existence of legal advice which will not usually amount to a waiver and cases in which the gist or substance of the legal advice has been disclosed see maurice at 481 488 and 493 ampolex ltd v perpetual trustee co canberra ltd 1996 hca 15 1996 70 aljr 603 at 607 ampolex ltd v perpetual trustee co canberra ltd 1996 40 nswlr 12 adelaide steamship co ltd v spalvins 1998 81 fcr 360 at 376377 and bennett v chief executive officer of the australian customs service 2004 fcafc 237 2004 140 fcr 101 bennett at 104105 6 9 in bennett the full court tamberlin emmett and gyles jj held that legal representatives of the australian customs service had waived privilege in legal advice by stating openly that they had given advice to customs that a particular regulation did not prohibit public comment by an officer on matters of public administration the trial judge had held that a disclosure of the legal position or stance that a lawyer had advised a client to take was not inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the communication giving the advice the trial judge also appeared to draw a distinction between statements which disclose the conclusion or logical result of legal advice and statements which disclose the content of the legal advice and its reasoning see tamberlin j at 105 10 and gyles j at 118 61 the full court rejected this approach gyles j stated at 119 65 that the voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice to which reference is made including the reasons for the conclusion tamberlin j said at 104 6 in my view it would be inconsistent and unfair having disclosed and used the substance of the advice in this way to now seek to maintain privilege in respect of the relevant parts of that advice which pertain to the expressed conclusion it may perhaps have been different if it had been simply asserted that the client has taken legal advice and that the position which was adopted having considered the advice is that certain action will be taken or not taken in those circumstances the substance of the advice is not disclosed but merely the fact that there was some advice and that it was considered however once the conclusion in the advice is stated together with the effect of it then in my view there is imputed waiver of the privilege the whole point of an advice is the final conclusion this is the situation in this case subsequently tamberlin j was confronted with a case that was very similar to the one he hypothesised in bennett in nine films and television pty ltd v ninox television ltd 2005 65 ipr 442 the applicant contended that the respondents had waived privilege in various legal advices because of the way in which the respondents had publicly referred to the advice tamberlin j held that there had been no waiver he concluded that the mere assertion that advice had been taken and the fact that action is then taken by the client is not sufficient unless the two are linked in such a way that it is apparent that the advice is that specified action should be taken his honour also made the following observations at 446447 26 whilst i accept that in some circumstances a clear disclosure of the bottom line of the advice and the course of conduct taken thereafter may be sufficient to amount to waiver of legal professional privilege i do not think these matters have been established in the present case on a fair and reasonable reading the statement to the effect that senior counsel had been engaged and that he had reviewed matters in detail and that steps were being taken based on his recommendations is not sufficient to amount to a waiver of the legal advice the substance or content of the advice is not disclosed with specificity or clarity questions of waiver are matters of fact and degree and in this instance i am not persuaded that the conduct assertions or admissible evidence are sufficient to warrant the necessary implication that legal professional privilege has been waived the principles discussed in bennett were applied in seven network ltd v news ltd no 12 2006 fca 348 the issue was whether a statement in a discovered document that our legal advice is that the risk of damages being awarded against optus is low had the consequence of waiving privilege in the legal advice that it referred to sackville j held that it did the statement voluntarily disclosed the gist or conclusion of the legal advice at 12 in rio tinto ltd v commissioner of taxation 2005 224 alr 299 the commissioner of taxation filed particulars with the court stating that the commissioner would be relying on specified grounds which have been confirmed by senior tax counsel and supported by ags and opinions obtained from counsel the taxpayer contended that the commissioner had thereby waived privilege in the legal advice of the australian government solicitor and the opinions of counsel sundberg j held that these references voluntarily disclosed the conclusion or substance of the advice and consequently privilege had been waived sundberg js decision went on appeal to the full court but the full courts decision turned on the alternative ground of issue waiver rio tinto at 72 the full court considered that in the particulars the commissioner had made an assertion that put the contents of the documents containing legal advice in issue or necessarily laid them open to scrutiny with the consequence that there was an inconsistency between the making of the assertion and the maintenance of the privilege awb submitted that the reasoning in bennett was unsound particularly the holding that the disclosure of the conclusion stated in legal advice will amount to a waiver of the whole of the advice awb did not refer to any authorities that supported this submission and i reject it in my view it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of the gist substance or conclusion of legal advice will amount to a waiver in respect of the whole of the relevant advice associated material turning to the scope of any imputed waiver it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of privileged documents can result in a waiver of privilege over those documents and associated material the test applied to determine the scope of any waiver of associated material is whether the material that the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the same issue or subject matter maurice at 482 and 484 per gibbs cj 488 per mason and brennan jj and 498 499 per dawson j in maurice gibbs cj said at 482 similarly where a party disclosed a document which contained part only of a memorandum which dealt with a single subjectmatter and then read the document to the judge in the course of opening the case it was held that privilege was waived as to the whole memorandum great atlantic insurance co v home insurance co in that case templeman lj said the rule that privilege relating to a document which deals with one subject matter cannot be waived as to part and asserted as to the remainder is based on the possibility that any use of part of a document may be unfair or misleading that the party who possesses the document is clearly not the person who can decide whether a partial disclosure is misleading or not nor can the judge decide without hearing argument nor can he hear argument unless the document is disclosed as a whole to the other side once disclosure has taken place by introducing part of the document into evidence or using it in court it cannot be erased the same test must be applied in deciding whether the use in legal proceedings of one document impliedly waives privilege in associated material in nea karteria maritime co ltd v atlantic amp great lakes steamship corporation no 2 mustill j dealt with this question and suggested the following test where a party is deploying in court material which would otherwise be privileged the opposite party and the court must have an opportunity of satisfying themselves that what the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the issue in question to allow an individual item to be plucked out of context would be to risk injustice through its real weight or meaning being misunderstood dawson j discussed the authorities at 498499 in geo doland ltd v blackburn robson coates amp co waiver of privilege with respect to a conversation between solicitor and client which took place before litigation was contemplated was held to extend to any other communications in relation to the subjectmatters of the conversation although the implied waiver was held not to cover similar documents which came into existence for the purpose of prosecuting the litigation this decision was not followed in general accident corporation ltd v tanter where a distinction was drawn between the waiver of privilege before a trial and the further waiver of privilege by calling evidence in a trial in the latter situation the waiver was held to extend to the transaction constituted by the privileged communication but not to the subjectmatter of that communication arising upon other privileged occasions general accident corporation ltd v tanter has been criticized for the distinction which it draws between waiver by the tender of evidence of a privileged communication and waiver by the disclosure of the communication in some other way and for the restriction which it places upon the extent of associative waiver see phipson on evidence par 1520 in nea karteria maritime co ltd v atlantic amp great lakes steamship corporation no 2 a broader view was taken by mustill j that where a party chooses to deploy evidence which would otherwise be privileged the court and the opposition must in relation to the issue in question be given the opportunity to satisfy themselves that they have the whole of the material and not merely a fragment this view was approved by the court of appeal in great atlantic insurance co v home insurance co in the united states it has been widely held that voluntary disclosure of the content of a privileged attorney communication constitutes waiver of the privilege with respect to all other such communications upon the same subjectmatter weil v investmentindicators research and management and the cases there cited diotima shipping corp v chase leavitt amp co united states v aronoff in re sealed case awb relied upon the way in which the principle was formulated by the court of appeal in british american tobacco australia services ltd v cowell 2002 vsca 197 2002 7 vr 524 at 564 121 a reference in one letter of advice to an earlier letter of advice does not expose the latter to scrutiny by the other party to litigation merely because legal professional privilege is waived in relation to the former implied waiver is not so generous a doctrine as we apprehend it where legal professional privilege is waived in relation to one piece or part of advice the privilege is impliedly waived in relation to another if and only if that other is necessary to a proper understanding of the first as established by the high court at least since mann v carnell the test in such cases is whether it would be inconsistent for a party to rely upon and so to waive legal professional privilege in respect of the one without also being taken to have waived privilege in respect of the other it is no doubt correct that a mere reference to the existence of legal advice in a disclosed document will not be regarded as a waiver of its contents albeit a different conclusion would follow if the gist substance or conclusion of the legal advice is voluntarily disclosed but with great respect to their honours the proposition concerning waiver of associated material is expressed too narrowly and in a way that is not consistent with the test propounded by the high court in maurice the principle propounded by the court of appeal may work adequately enough in some circumstances particularly where privilege is sought to be maintained over one part of a single piece of legal advice but in other circumstances it will not give effect to the principles explained in maurice a common application of associated material waiver relates to the case where an expert report has been prepared in reliance upon other documents in australian securities amp investments commission v southcorp ltd 2003 46 acsr 438 at 441442 21 lindgren j summarised the applicable principles 1 ordinarily the confidential briefing or

such an advice and the advice or report of an expert retained for the purpose of the litigation as i have indicated i am satisfied that counsel relied upon instructions which they were given and it would appear relied upon medical reports in a way which influenced the content of the advice which they gave accordingly insofar as there are documents which were relied upon in the preparation of the advice falling within categories 1 2 3 and 5 of the notice to produce the service of the affidavit impliedly waived privilege in those documents later at 20 his honour said in the present case the

both in the advice itself and the documents which were used by counsel and which influenced the content of the advice waiver having occurred the fact that the advice was not ultimately tendered is to my mind not relevant having sought an advantage the plaintiff was bound by the course he had taken and accordingly is amenable to producing the relevant documents in response to an appropriate notice to produce in newcrest mining wa limited v commonwealth 1993 40 fcr 507 french j applied the principle of associated material waiver in a case where one joint venturer disclosed significant elements of legal advice it had obtained in relation to mining leases held by the joint venture partners his honour held that the disclosure brought about an implied waiver of other legal advices obtained by the other joint venturers in relation to the mining leases his honour said at 509 that it was significant that the disclosures were made for the benefit of the joint venture as a whole and although there was no direct evidence on the point he considered that it was difficult to imagine that the disclosures would have occurred against the wishes of the other joint venturers or indeed without their consent in england the principle has been applied to documents which underpin or support expert evidence see dunlop slazenger international ltd v joe bloggs sports limited 2003 edwca civ 901 mayne pharma pty ltd v debiopharm sa 2006 ewhc 164 pat and loreal sa v bellure nv 2006 ewhc 1503 ch several english cases illustrate the practical operation of the principle in nea karteria maritime co ltd v atlantic amp great lakes steamship corporation no 2 1981 com lr 138 nea karteria a lawyer gave evidence that he had conducted an interview on the basis of a list of questions prepared by the plaintiffs lawyers while privilege was waived with respect to the witnesses answers the plaintiffs sought to maintain privilege with respect to the list of questions at 139140 mustill j as his lordship then was held at 140 that privilege over the list of questions had been waived by implication it seems to me that the written questions were so to speak part of the meeting they were in a sense an agenda for the meeting they formed the basis for onehalf of the exchange between the lawyer and the witness evidence to that effect having been given by the lawyer it seems to me that privilege must have been waived for those questions and i think the interests of justice which i believe to underlie the authorities on this part of the case demand that the opposition and the court should have an opportunity to satisfy itself as to the accuracy of the evidence given to the lawyer as to the way in which he conducted the interview mustill j drew a distinction at 140 between the instructions to the lawyer who carried out the questioning and the questions themselves the instructions did not play a part in the meeting did not form part of the body of events upon which the court had to reach conclusions of fact and were merely part of the prior history of those events in r v secretary of state for transport ex parte factortame 1997 9 admin lr 591 at 599 auld lj made the following observations concerning the application of the test stated in nea karteria much depends on whether the party making partial disclosure seeks to represent by so doing that the disclosed documents go to part or the whole of an issue in question the expression used by mustill j in the passage from his judgment in nea karteria that i have cited the issue may be confined to what was said or done in a single transaction or it may be more complex than that and extend over a series of connected events or transactions in each case the question for the court is whether the matters in issue and the document or documents in respect of which partial disclosure has been made are respectively severable so that the partially disclosed material clearly does not bear on matters in issue in respect of which material is withheld the more confined the issue for example as to the content of a single document or conversation the more difficult it is likely to be to withhold by severance part of the document or other documents relevant to the document or conversation in fulham leisure holdings ltd v nicholson graham amp jones 2006 2 all er 599 fulham at 604 11 mann j suggested that it was helpful to approach the application of the test stated in nea karteria in three steps first identify the transaction in respect of which the disclosure has been made secondly ascertain from the nature of the disclosure or other evidence whether the transaction is wider than an advice given on a single occasion if so the whole of the wider transaction must be disclosed and thirdly the disclosure of the whole transaction may make it plain that further disclosure is necessary to avoid unfairness or misunderstanding of what has been disclosed mann j added at 607 18 that once the transaction has been identified the cases show that the whole of the material relevant to that transaction must be disclosed it is not open to a waiving party to say that the transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose the court will determine objectively what the real transaction is so that the scope of the waiver can be determined his lordship also said that the application of these principles will be very fact sensitive and will vary from case to case at 607 19 waiver has been established at 70 to 126 above i set out my findings as to the precise terms in which awb disclosed the results of its legal reviews and legal advice it had obtained to the australian government the iic and the commission overall i am satisfied that by means of these disclosures awb deployed the gist or substance of legal advice it had obtained moreover i am satisfied that awb made a conscious and voluntary decision to deploy this legal advice in its dealings with the australian government the iic and the commission because it considered that it was in its commercial interests to do so these actions are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the legal advice having regard to the nature purpose terms and extent of its disclosures i am also satisfied that awb acted inconsistently with the maintenance of confidentiality over the associated material which underpinned the legal advice while these overall conclusions are relevant and important i have taken the view that it is necessary and appropriate for me to make specific findings as to the nature and consequences of each such disclosure i turn to that task in his various statements to the australian government hargreaves did not merely refer to the existence of legal advice nor did he simply disclose the legal advice which had been obtained by awb from mr tracey qc he described in some detail the findings and conclusions that had been arrived at by awbs own legal review in my opinion hargreaves thereby disclosed to the australian government the gist or substance of legal advice that awb had obtained as at the relevant dates at which he made his disclosures that there was no evidence of 8226 corruption by awb 8226 side payments or after sales payments by awb to the former iraqi regime 8226 any knowledge on the part of awb that alia was connected with the iraqi regime or that payments were being channelled by alia to that regime 8226 any conduct by awb that resulted in breaches of the united nations sanctions 8226 any other wrongdoing or improper conduct by awb in connection with the supply of wheat to iraq under the off programme when hargreaves gave his briefings to officers of the australian government he expressed himself in terms that were apt to refer and which a reasonable listener would have understood as referring to the combined effect of all of the legal advice that awb had received as at the date of the relevant briefing hargreaves would not have been understood as referring only to a particular piece of historical advice regardless of whether it was overtaken or qualified or supported by later advice his assertions purported to represent the current state of affairs hargreaves memorandum of 25 june 2005 makes it quite clear that his statements to the australian government were based upon all of the legal advice awb had obtained and not simply the advice it had obtained from mr tracey qc it cannot be disputed that hargreaves disclosed the substance of the legal advice which blakes provided to awbs board on 25 may 2004 awb has already formed that view and acted on it by producing blakes power point presentation to the commission but in my view the consequence of hargreaves disclosures cannot be confined to blakes advice of 25 may 2004 and mr tracey qcs advices through the remainder of 2004 and until hargreaves had his last meeting with ms carayanides in the period between 16 june 2005 and september 2005 hargreaves met with australian government representatives several times and continued to make assertions that awbs independent legal review had not identified any wrongdoing by awb the evidence shows that blakes and minters continued the legal review in 2004 and 2005 and provided ongoing legal advice to awb it is not open to a waiving party to say that the disclosures relate simply to one advice and not others or that the relevant transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose the court will determine objectively what has been disclosed see fulham at 607 18 hargreaves memorandum of 25 june 2005 makes it plain that he deliberately deployed awbs legal advice in his dealings with the australian government he did so as part of awbs strategy to secure the continued support of the federal government both generally and in relation to awbs dealings with the iic and the united states government hargreaves also deployed the advice in pursuit of the objectives that he set out in his memorandum they included protecting and defending the reputation of awb both within australia and overseas and minimising any attack by us wheat interests on awbs position as the exclusive manager of wheat exports from australia given these strategic objectives it was important for awb to disclose indeed to stress that it had conducted an extensive independent legal review which had found no evidence of any wrongdoing by awb in connection with its exports of wheat to iraq by disclosing its legal advice to secure these objectives awb assumed the risk that it would be held to have waived legal professional privilege in connection with legal advices it obtained in the course of the legal review having regard to the legal principles governing waiver i consider that any legal advice that awb obtained from blakes or minters prior to hargreaves last meeting with ms carayanides on any of the subject matters or relating to any of the issues described at 180 above has been waived by reason of the disclosures made by hargreaves those subject matters and issues are wide enough to encompass the tigris transaction and the iron filings claim if awb obtained legal advice during this period on those subject matters or relating to those issues from persons other than blakes or minters such as abl mr tracey qc or others that advice has also been waived by hargreaves disclosures i am satisfied that the disclosures to the iic involved a disclosure by awb of the gist or substance of legal advice that it had obtained by 28 february 2005 the disclosure occurred at two points first when lindberg was interviewed on 28 february 2005 the interview took place in the presence of awbs legal representative awb had the ability to object to any statements by lindberg that intruded into areas covered by legal professional privilege no objection was raised to lindbergs statement that the legal review conducted by cooper had found nothing that would substantiate claims of fraud or corruption by awb or payments by awb to individuals in the government of iraq secondly awb was directly involved in providing the record of interview as revised by lindberg and awbs lawyers to the iic in my opinion the record of interview describes the gist or substance of legal advice which awb had obtained as a result of its legal review as with hargreaves lindbergs assertions purported to describe the current state of affairs ie as at 28 february 2005 there is no reason to read his assertions as if they were confined to legal advice obtained from mr tracey qc it extends in my view to any legal advice obtained by awb from blakes minters and mr tracey qc and any advice from others prior to 28 february 2005 that deals with the same subject matters or relates to the same issues as the advice that lindberg described i am satisfied that the disclosures to the iic were made deliberately and consciously by awb with a view to obtaining a finding from the iic that awb had not engaged or at least had not knowingly engaged in conduct that involved making payments to the iraqi regime in breach of the united nations sanctions lindberg and awb went out of their way to stress that the company had undertaken a legal review which had found nothing to substantiate claims of fraud corruption or improper payments to the iraqi regime the disclosures were made with the knowledge and intention that they would be referred to by the iic in its final published report accordingly i find that awb consciously and voluntarily deployed its legal advice with the object and intention of furthering the companys commercial and other interests awb contended that the disclosures which lindberg made at his meeting with the minister for foreign affairs on 4 october 2005 were confined to the advice given by mr tracey qc this is a possible interpretation of the departments minute but in my view lindbergs statements are not to be read and would not have been understood so narrowly later in the meeting lindberg said that awb had acted in accordance with the sanctions regime and that this had been supported by legal advice this statement was expressed broadly and was not confined to independent legal advice in my view lindberg disclosed and a reasonable listener would have understood that lindberg was disclosing the gist or substance of all of the legal advice that awb had obtained up to 4 october 2005 in relation to the question whether awb had acted in accordance with the sanctions regime the disclosure extends to mr tracey qcs memorandum of advice dated 22 september 2005 and professor wippmans advice dated 27 september 2005 at the meeting with the minister for foreign affairs lindberg stewart and other representatives of awb were providing awbs answer to the iics draft findings as communicated to awb in the iics letter of 26 september 2005 the minute shows that awbs representatives were very concerned to explain awbs claims of innocence and to secure the governments ongoing support lindberg told the meeting that the iic had ignored awbs explanations and that the socalled evidence relied on by the iic did not support its factual findings in support of these contentions lindberg asserted that awb had legal advice confirming that awb had not acted in contravention of the sanctions regime i infer that awb made a conscious and voluntary decision to deploy this legal advice at the meeting with the minister so as to secure the ongoing support of the australian government in doing so it assumed the risk of any consequential waiver of legal professional privilege in my opinion blakes presentation to awbs board on 25 may 2004 constituted legal advice for the purposes of the doctrine of legal professional privilege awb withdrew its claim of privilege and produced the complete presentation to the commissioner in april this year the presentation not only discloses the substance of the legal advice from blakes but also some of its detail and foundations in my opinion one consequence of this disclosure is that awb has waived privilege over any other legal advice that it obtained prior to 25 may 2004 in relation to the same subject matters or the same issues as blakes addressed in its presentation awb contends that lindbergs evidence to the commission on 17 january 2006 did not disclose the gist or conclusion of any legal advice i disagree in my opinion it disclosed the gist or substance of legal advice that awb had previously obtained as to whether awb had engaged in conduct in breach of the united nations sanctions and whether awb had paid inland transportation fees to alia as a conduit for the payment of money to the iraqi regime in the course of his evidence lindberg went out of his way to assert that the legal review that cooper had instituted assisted by external legal advisers had reported periodically and did not find any evidence to substantiate the allegations that awb had made payments in breach of the sanctions in one instance at least lindbergs assertions to this effect were not directly responsive to the question asked of him by counsel assisting the commission lindberg gave these answers in the presence of counsel for awb without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege i am satisfied that by means of this evidence awb voluntarily deployed the legal advice that it had obtained prior to 17 january 2006 i infer that it did so because it considered it was in its interests for it to be publicly known that awb had conducted an extensive legal review which had found no evidence of any wrongdoing in his evidence lindberg specifically referred to a series of periodical reports from those undertaking the legal review there were a number of reports and the findings of those reports are recorded in the minutes and the basis of those findings has been communicated in letters that have been sent to the government and elsewhere i find that in his evidence to the commission lindberg was referring to the combined effect of all of the legal advice that awb received during the course of the internal review as periodical reports were made to the boards of awb and awbi it follows in my view that lindbergs evidence has the consequence that awb has waived privilege over any legal advice that it obtained in the course of the review that goes to the same subject matters or relates to the same issues as the legal advice that lindberg described in the course of his evidence in relation to mr tracey qcs advices awb produced his written advices of 8 june 2004 31 march 2005 and 12 august 2005 to the commission early in april 2006 in my view the consequence of this production is that awb must be taken to have waived legal professional privilege in any other legal advices that it obtained prior to mr tracey qcs last advice of 12 august 2005 in relation to the same subjects or issues as already mentioned i also consider that quite separately awb has waived privilege over the advice it obtained from mr tracey qc on 22 september 2005 in relation to resolution 661 as a result of the project water investigations the directors of awb obtained legal advice from cooper at the board meeting on 14 december 2004 that the tigris transaction complied with all necessary laws and involved no breaches of law a handwritten note of that advice has been produced to the commission awb was entitled to claim that this note was protected from production to the commission by legal professional privilege it did not claim privilege i infer that it did not do so because it wanted it to be known publicly that awb had advice as of 14 december 2004 to the effect that the tigris transaction complied with all necessary laws and involved no breaches by awb having disclosed the gist or substance of its legal advice in this manner it would be inconsistent to allow awb to maintain confidentiality and privilege in any other legal advices that awb obtained prior to 14 december 2004 dealing with the same subject matter or the same issues the advice that cooper gave to awbs board on 14 december 2004 related specifically to the tigris transaction however i consider that the other disclosures that i have already discussed were expressed in such broad terms that they encompassed any advices concerning the tigris transaction andor the iron filings claim as a result i consider that there has been a waiver of other advices about the tigris transaction such as mr tracey qcs memorandum of 26 october 2004 document 353a the cumulative effect of awbs disclosures is that down to 17 january 2006 when lindberg gave evidence to the commission awb was openly claiming that its legal advice showed that there was no evidence that it had engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with its supply of wheat to iraq under the off programme including wrongdoing of the kind described at 180 above i find that awb made these claims to advance its commercial interests awbs conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in any advices dealing with the same subjects or issues in addition lindberg cooper and scales gave evidence to the commission that awb obtained legal advice that the proceeds of the inflated prices in contracts a1670 and a1680 should be disbursed to tigris to the extent of approximately us7 million that evidence was given in the presence of awbs legal representatives without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege again i infer that awb was content for it to be publicly known that it had obtained that legal advice having disclosed the gist or substance of that advice awb is bound to disclose any other legal advices it obtained in relation to the same subject or same issue awbs revised list of privileged documents contains several advices relating to the tigris payment they include documents 337 and 385 documents 1088 1089 1092 1093 and 1094 record the substance of those advices in minutes of meetings held by the awb and awbi boards in december 2004 and february 2005 and the chairmans running sheets for the february 2005 meetings the evidence which lindberg cooper and scales gave in public before the commission is inconsistent with awbs attempt to maintain privilege in these documents one question which remains to be dealt with is whether the scope of the waiver that must in my view be imputed to awb is to be confined to any other legal advice that awb obtained prior to the date of the relevant disclosures that addressed the same subject matters or issues as the advice that awb voluntarily disclosed in my opinion the waiver is not so confined it extends to the documents and information which were taken into account in formulating or which otherwise underpinned or influenced the legal advice that awb has chosen to disclose the commonwealth argued that awbs disclosures are broad enough to encompass any legal advice which awb obtained and any documents which awbs lawyers reviewed or created in the course of the project rose and project water investigations the difficulty with this way of approaching the boundaries of the waiver of associated material is that the terms project rose and project water have an indefinite and imprecise ambit according to the authorities discussed above the limits of any waiver of associated material depend upon the nature of the advice that has been disclosed what was represented by means of the disclosure and the character of the transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice regard must also be had to the way in which awbs legal advice was described in the various disclosures essentially by means of the disclosures awb was asserting that a detailed legal review had been undertaken and that it had concluded that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing or other improper conduct by awb in connection with its sale of wheat to iraq under the off programme in my opinion the nature and character of this disclosure is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in those documents which were taken into account by awbs legal advisers in arriving at the advice they gave to adapt the language used by mcclellan cj at common law in thomas at 17 and 20 awbs disclosures of its legal advice effect a waiver of privilege in the documents which were reviewed for the purposes of that advice or which influenced its content furthermore awb emphasised the breadth of its internal review in its various disclosures in my view awb thereby waived privilege in documents which define the scope of the review or which reveal what investigations were in fact undertaken in the course of the review much the same answer follows if one asks what was the legal exercise or transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice see factortame at 598599 and fulham at 604 11 and 607 18 having regard to the form of the legal advice disclosed by awb the relevant legal exercise or transaction encompassed a review of original documents and witness interviews as well as summaries chronologies or other analytical documents prepared by the lawyers with a view to determining whether there was any improper or wrongful conduct by awb material of this kind underpinned or influenced the legal advice which awb has chosen to disclose and it is not severable from that advice there is a certain symmetry in defining the boundaries of the waiver of associated material in this way documents brought into existence in the course of a lawyers factual investigation are prima facie capable of attracting legal professional privilege where the investigation is being undertaken for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice if the client voluntarily discloses the gist or substance of the legal advice that is founded upon such investigations the rationale for according privilege to the investigative material will have disappeared while i would go further the approach that i have described is not unlike the approach that awb has already taken in connection with the production to the commission of mr tracey qcs memoranda of advice and instructions in the case of mr tracey qcs oral advice of 25 may 2004 and his confirmatory memorandum of 12 august 2005 awb determined correctly in my view that the underlying documents supplied to mr tracey qc must also be produced awb considered that the form of mr tracey qcs advice ie there was no evidence of wrongdoing meant that it was impossible to separate his legal advice from the copy documents that were supplied to him as part of his instructions the evidence before me does not reveal whether awb adopted the same approach to mr tracey qcs advice of 31 march 2005 when he was asked to provide this advice copy documents were supplied to mr tracey qc as part of his instructions but there is no evidence one way or the other as to whether those copy documents have been produced to the commission the substance of mr tracey qcs advice was that nothing in the documents supplied to him as of 31 march 2005 had caused him to vary his earlier advice of 25 may 2004 this advice cannot be separated from the documents that were supplied to him and accordingly awbs express waiver of privilege in his advice extends to all of the documents and instructions supplied to him the applicable principle can also be illustrated by reference to the advice that blakes gave in its presentation of 25 may 2004 the advice that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by awb that involved a breach of the united nations sanctions was explicitly founded upon a review of a large number of documents and interviews of awb personnel having regard to the form of its advice it is impossible to separate blakes advice from the underlying documentation and interviews however the witness interviews and other materials that blakes relied upon to formulate its advice have not been produced to the commission and are still the subject of claims for legal professional privilege in my opinion those claims of privilege are not maintainable privilege has been waived by inter alia the production of blakes advice the same approach must be adopted to any advices that blakes provided after 25 may 2004 on the question whether any evidence had emerged of any wrongdoing or improper conduct on the part of awb another question which remains to be dealt with is the extent of any waiver that arises from awbs production to the commission of the instructions to sir anthony mason in its particulars setting forth its objections to awbs privilege claims the commonwealth contended that these disclosures had brought about a waiver of legal professional privilege in relation to project rose it tendered the instructions which abl provided to sir anthony mason on 16 september and 20 october 2005 and the expert opinion which sir anthony mason provided dated 24 october 2005 however the commonwealth did not direct any submissions to this aspect of its waiver case either orally or in its written submissions nor did awb address any oral or written submissions to the consequences which flowed from its production to the commission of the instructions to and the advice obtained from sir anthony mason it must be borne in mind that awb is seeking a declaration that all of the documents set forth in its revised list of privileged documents are the subject of legal professional privilege these documents include documents by which awb obtained legal advice both in australia and in the united states concerning the applicability of resolution 661 the instructions to sir anthony mason summarised the gist or substance of the very same legal advice in these circumstances i have concluded that the court must take account of the evidence that has been placed before it by disclosing the instructions given to sir anthony mason awb has in my opinion disclosed the substance of legal advice it had obtained as at 20 october 2005 both in australia and in the united states as to the applicability of resolution 661 this disclosure encompasses mr tracey qcs memorandum of 22 september 2005 and professor wippmans advice of 27 september 2005 thus far i have identified the principles which define the boundaries of the waiver that is to be imputed to awb including the boundaries of any waiver of associated material the remaining task in disposing of the waiver arguments is to determine precisely what documents fall within these boundaries i have carried out that task by inspecting the documents over which claims of privilege have been made reviewing the evidence concerning each document and applying the principles identified above as a result i have determined that awb has waived any legal professional privilege that would otherwise attach to the documents as listed under the heading conclusions below the iron filings claim communications between a lawyer and client which facilitate a crime or fraud are not protected by legal professional privilege this principle is often referred to as the fraud exception to legal professional privilege but this does not capture its full reach attorneygeneral nt v kearney 1985 hca 60 1985

power to defeat a land claim under the aboriginal land rights northern territory act 1976 cth in his reasons for judgment gibbs cj with whom mason and brennan jj agreed stated at 515 that legal professional privilege will be denied to a communication which is made for the purpose of frustrating the processes of the law itself even though no crime or fraud is contemplated some authorities have expressed the principle as applicable to prevent a fraud on justice in a broad sense the concept of a fraud on justice was adopted by lander j in gartner v carter 2004 fca 258 gartner v carter to deny protection to a communication between a lawyer and client for the purpose of the client putting assets beyond the reach of the legitimate claims of secured creditors at 130 and 139140 the principle extends to trickery and shams a sham refers to steps which take the form of a legally effective transaction but which the parties intend should not have the apparent or any legal

transaction in that case creditors of a managed investment scheme claimed privilege over documents relating to securities obtained from the defendant and certain companies in the scheme the transactions were allegedly entered into so as to advance those creditors interests over the interests of other creditors to the scheme mansfield j found that the communications were prima facie in furtherance of a sham and as such were not privileged after referring to lander js decision in gartner v carter and barclays bank plc v eustice 1995 4 all er 511 barclays bank his honour stated at 95 it is a short step from those decisions to the present facts as prima facie found the creditors engaged in the transactions reflected in the deed and the granting of the securities within the structures it created to secure or advance their interests over others who had advanced money to the first defendant or to the scheme there is a prima facie case that the restructure of the advances so that they appear as advances to the partnership of ajay and opey is a sham mansfield j drew a distinction at 96100 between communications to obtain advice in relation to what if anything could lawfully be done to improve the prospects of being repaid or of obtaining the interest to which the client was entitled which were privileged and communications which have the effect of concealing the true nature of a transaction and which enable a client to present a picture which is not true which were not privileged where a client is engaged in fraudulent conduct communications with his or her lawyer in furtherance of the fraud are not privileged regardless of whether the lawyer is a party to the fraud or not clements at 562 213 the principle applies to communications passing between a client and lawyer where the lawyer is innocent of the fraud or improper purpose r v bell ex parte lees 1980 hca 26 1980 146 clr 141 at 145 further the fraud need not be that of the client or the

217218 it is important to bear in mind that the fraud exception is based on public policy grounds the principle is sufficiently flexible to capture a range of situations where the protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client would be contrary to the public interest see kearney at 514515 r v cox at 614 this aspect of the principle is reflected in the statement that the privilege takes flight if the relationship between lawyer and client is abused clark v united states 1933 289 us 1 at 15 see also kearney at 514 and 524 in barclays bank communications between the client and his lawyer in relation to the setting up of transactions at an undervalue so as to prejudice the bank were held to be sufficiently iniquitous for public policy to require those communications to be discoverable schiemann lj with whom aldous and butlersloss ljj agreed stated at 524 if that view be correct then it matters not whether either the client or the solicitor shared that view they may well have thought that the transactions would not fall to be set aside either because they thought that the transactions were not at an undervalue or because they thought that the court would not find that the purpose of the transactions was to prejudice the bank but if this is what they thought then there is a strong prima facie case that they were wrong public policy does not require the communications of those who misapprehend the law to be privileged in circumstances where no privilege attaches to those who correctly understand the situation for the principle to apply

statement must be made in clear and definite terms and there must further be some prima facie evidence that it has some foundation in fact the high court in propend applied this test at 514 per brennan cj at 521 per dawson j 534 per toohey j 546 per gaudron j 556 per mchugh j and 592 per kirby j it is not necessary to prove an improper purpose on the balance of probabilities the prima facie test arguably reflects the fact that issues of legal professional privilege are usually dealt with in the interlocutory stages of a proceeding but the authorities have not departed from that formulation where a declaration is sought in relation to privilege issues butler propend beazley it must also be established on the same prima facie basis that the communication which is the subject of the claim for privilege was made in furtherance of or as a step preparatory to the commission of the fraud or wrongdoing in butler goff j found at 687 that a letter written by the plaintiffs lawyer which volunteered a warning that the plaintiff may incur serious consequences if he did not take care was not shown to be in preparation for or in furtherance of or as part of any criminal designs on the part of the plaintiff see also zemanek v commonwealth bank of australia unreported federal court hill j 2 october 1997 in propend the high court considered whether a charge of improper purpose must be based on evidence that is admissible in the proceeding the only evidence of alleged illegality before the trial judge in propend was the sworn information which supported the issue of a search warrant for the relevant documents the court held that while the sworn information was admissible to establish the basis upon which the warrant was issued it was not admissible to show that the copy documents were not privileged see at 514 per brennan cj 557 per mchugh j 576 per gummow j 547 per gaudron j and 593 per kirby j the iron filings claim refers to a claim by gbi for a rebate of us201613300 on account of the fact that earlier shipments of wheat by awb to gbi had been contaminated by iron filings lindberg agreed to pay this sum to gbi in settlement of the iron filings claim in about october 2002 during the course of a visit to bagdad an email dated 7 november 2002 from chris whitwell of awb whitwell to lindberg and others reporting on the trip to iraq in october 2002 stated that the responsible iraqi minister had asked for repayment of the iron filings rebate through the inland transport mechanism the same email referred to the fact that the iraqi minister was seeking cabinet approval for repayment of the tigris debt at the outset of this case the commonwealth contended that any legal advice that awb obtained in connection with the tigris transaction was waived by virtue of awbs production to the commission of a partly masked memorandum of 7 february 2003 dealing with the subject of the iron filings payment and tigris petroleum fee on the first day of the hearing awb announced that it was no longer seeking a declaration of privilege in respect of documents connected with the tigris transaction which the commonwealth sought to challenge on the basis of the fraud exception subsequently awb made it clear that this concession did not extend to six documents relating to the iron filings rebate payment during the course of the hearing in this court awb produced an unmasked copy of the memorandum of 7 february 2003 and provided it to the commonwealth the commonwealth tendered the memorandum as an exhibit in this proceeding without any objection from awb the memorandum contains a fairly full description of the way in which awb planned to pay the iron filings claim to gbi the memorandum which was sent by whitwell to messrs geary and long with copies to scales johnson hogan johnstone cooper lyons hockey and thomas states private and confidential this memo is in respect to refunding the grain board of iraq the quality rebate of approx usd 2016133 through the inland transport payments for the new contract as requested by the minister of trade iraq in addition for the record is amp m has negotiated through an uplift in price the recovery of a usd 8375 million outstanding debt to tigris by igb through this contract awb will repay this debt back to tigris less an agreed recovery fee of usd 500 k on a pro rata basis as tonnage is shipped overview delegation led by andrew lindberg august 2002 to baghdad agreed to settle the contamination of the iron filings vessels by paying them usd 6 pmt for each vessel total usd 2016133 after being approached by tigris petroleum awb and igb have agreed to allow the new contract to be the conduit for a repayment of usd 8375000 owed to tigris by igb for a cargo of wheat shipped in 1996 igb have agreed to raising the contract price by the debt amount and when payments are made under the letter of credit awb will pay tigris its debt less awbs recovery fee we have suggested the following during our last two visits 8226 offsetting the debt against the outstanding debt to tigris petroleum approx usd 835 million 8226 reducing the any new contract price sic by the amount of the rebate on a pmt basis 8226 repaying the debt through the provision of aid in some form wheat health supplies etc however in discussion with the minister of trade he has continually insisted on repayment directly as an addition to the inland transport and said that this was his understanding of the agreement with andrew lindberg michael long was present and confirms that this was discussed now that the new contract has been concluded ism need a sign off to organise this payment when shipments start issues 8226 possible implications for awb on a corporate governance basis ie direct payment to a company with links to the iraqi regime may be construed to be in contravention of the un sanctions the relevant un security council resolution is 661 1990 this resolution provides at clause 4 all states shall not make available to the government of iraq or to any commercial industrial or public utility undertaking in iraq any funds or any other financial or economic resources and shall prevent their nationals and any persons within their territories from removing from their territories or otherwise making available to that government or to any such undertaking any such funds or resources and from remitting any other funds to persons or bodies within iraq except payments exclusively for strictly medical or humanitarian purposes and in humanitarian circumstances foodstuffs in summary this means that the government of the commonwealth of australia would be obliged to prevent awb limited from making any remittance of funds to the igb awb legal opinion in this regard is set out below this does not mean however that a payment might not be able to be made which will comply with the terms of the un resolutions as a minimum if awb management determines to make the payment then it should be made in the following circumstances 1 the payment is made in installments over time and coincides with payments for future shipments of wheat ie not a lump sum payment 2 the payments preferably be made to a company other than the igb and in a jurisdiction other than iraq and 3 the payments be recorded as being made as a part of a settlement reached between awb and igb the terms of which contemplated that igb would agree not to take any action against awb for the alleged contamination of the 8 vessels in 2002 with iron filings and would agree to enter into contracts for the purchase of australian bulk wheat in the future in exchange for a renegotiation of the price on the 8 vessels if we ensure that the above requirements are met then legal consider it will be at least arguable that we are not making funds or financial resources available to the iraqi government instead we are repaying part of the contract price for the 8 vessels following a renegotiation of the sale price due to a downgrading of the grain which potentially contained iron filings in addition to the above the un security council resolutions also require resolution 986 1995 clause 8 that the cost of food exports to iraq must be met by draw down from the un escrow account furthermore draw down from the escrow account is only allowable under strict conditions those conditions include at clause 8aiii that the goods to which payment is referable shall have arrived in iraq in this case the goods have already arrived in iraq and have been paid for in full however the resolutions are silent on the procedure for any repayment of part of the price in circumstances where there has been a quality complaint and a subsequent renegotiation of price this may therefore give us more scope to make the repayment to igb even if we make payment as outlined above there is still a risk that the australian government andor the united nations will take a contrary view on the interpretation of the above mentioned resolutions and declare that awb has breached the terms of those resolutions by making the payment this is a commercial and political issue which awbs management will need to consider 8226 according to an informal discussion with dfat any repayment of a quality rebate should be either repayed through un escrow account or as a contract price reduction however they have not had a full legal argument put in front of them or been told officially in public affairs opinion as long as the repayment is legal and could not be seen to be breaking un sanctions then we should proceed with the proviso that we have an independent legal opinion to that effect see above legal opinion public affairs also expressed concern that this would not be well received by the un oip office and that there was a reasonable chance of them finding out is amp m on the other hand do not want them involved and feel confident that this issue could be handled without the need for the oip to be consulted it has been articulated to us and we have circumstantial evidence that other participants in the oip program russian and pakistani companies have had to sort out quality problems in a similar way and it is unlikely either their national governments or the oip were consulted 8226 is amp m feel strongly that a failure to repay the igb as discussed will lead to serious consequences for awbs relationship with the igb is amp m also believe that failure to refund this agreed debt in this way would have serious implications for the execution of the new contracts awbi are aware of all the issues laid out above and in light of the commercial imperative of this situation agree with the recommendation as laid out below they do however insist that the managing director is appraised of the situation actions whilst is amp m have received a number of different opinions from different areas of awb and an informal opinion from dfat we still feel this issue is a grey area with no prescriptive answers based on the opinions we do have and the commercial circumstances surrounding this issue is amp m recommend and seek approval for the following 8226 is amp m is to repay debt as per method outlined in awbs legal opinion and requested by the minister of trade directly to alia transport in jordan in instalments is amp m will also look to obtain written agreement from igb to the payment in the format agreed by legal however it is not guaranteed 8226 managing director only to convey our intentions to the australian government at the appropriate time prior to shipment the timing of such a disclosure is important and we would recommend that nothing be done until at least letters of credit are in place for these contracts given that this is unlikely to happen until after a war with iraq it may allow us a further chance of renegotiation with a new regime 8226 is amp m to finalise as soon as possible a written agreement with tigris with regard to the settlement of their debt original emphasis omitted the evidence before me establishes to the requisite prima facie standard that the price in contracts a1670 and a1680 was inflated to cover both the amount of the iron filings claim and the repayment by gbi of the debt which it owed to tigris a surcharge of us8375 pmt was added to each contract in respect of the tigris debt as shown by an email from nigel edmondswilson to scales and others at awb dated 12 december 2002 the same email shows that in each contract the inland transportation fee was set at us5115 pmt at the commission mr geary of awb gave evidence that the prices in these two contracts were inflated to cover a component for the tigris debt and a component for the us2 million iron filings rebate he also said that the united nations was not advised at any stage that the prices for wheat in these two contracts had been inflated in this way so as to cover the tigris debt and the iron filings claim to adopt the words of viscount finlay in orourke the evidence gives ample colour to the charge that the prices in these two contracts were falsely misrepresented the evidence shows that the prices in the two wheat contracts were inflated as a means of extracting money from the united nations escrow account having regard to the terms of the memorandum of 7 february 2003 there are reasonable grounds for believing that having extracted approximately us2 million from the escrow account to meet the iron filings claim awb planned to pay that money in instalments to gbi via the mechanism of inland transportation fees the material before me including whitwells email of 7 november 2002 and his memorandum of 7 february 2003 indicates clearly that awb knew that paying inland transportation fees to alia was a means of making payments to the iraqi government this plan was concealed from the united nations the planned payments of the iron filings claim were never carried into effect because the invasion of iraq intervened scales gave evidence to the commission that the iron filings money has never been paid and remains in awbis accounts however the fact that the payments were never made to the gbi will not prevent the application of the fraud exception so long as there is sufficient evidence that the communications were in furtherance of or preparatory to the commission of the fraud or impropriety in the broad sense described above see butler and clements at 562 213 in my view the evidence establishes a more than adequate prima facie case that awb knowingly and deliberately disguised the true nature of the prices in contracts a1670 and a1680 if it be relevant i also consider that the evidence establishes the foregoing matters on the balance of probabilities and to a level of satisfaction commensurate with the seriousness of the allegation see briginshaw v briginshaw 1938 hca 34 1938 60 clr 336 at 362 per dixon j no question arises here of evidence which would not be admissible in a final hearing cf propend awb argued that there was no evidence that the transaction furthered any particular fraud iniquity or illegality it submitted that it is common ground that the united nations resolutions were not in terms incorporated into australian law awb submitted that consequently the fraud exception is not available to take the documents out of the operation of the doctrine of legal professional privilege this narrow approach is at odds with the authorities that stress the wide range of fraudulent or iniquitous activities that fall within the principle i have inspected the six documents that were said to relate to the iron filings claim my inspection of awbs documents revealed a further four documents that fall within this category and are still the subject of a privilege claim i am satisfied that these 10 documents are not privileged the documents were prima facie brought into existence in furtherance of an improper and dishonest purpose viz inflating the prices of contracts a1670 and a1680 so as to extract payments out of the united nations escrow account that would then be utilised in part to satisfy a compensation claim by gbi prima facie the evidence establishes that the transaction was deliberately and dishonestly structured by awb so as to misrepresent the true nature and purpose of the trucking fees and to work a trickery on the united nations it would be contrary to public policy for the privilege to enure in communications of this kind the 10 documents in question are listed below in my conclusions there is an alternative basis for rejecting awbs claim for privilege over the 10 iron filings documents awbs disclosure of the memorandum of 7 february 2003 and its tender by the commonwealth as an exhibit in these proceedings without any objection or claim to confidentiality by awb effects a waiver over the subject matter of the legal advice set out in the memorandum my inspection of the 10 documents relating to the iron filings claim confirms my view that those documents relate to the subjects and issues that are canvassed in the memorandum of 7 february 2003 if contrary to my view any privilege subsisted in any of the documents it has been waived by awb when the commonwealth tendered the unmasked version of the memorandum of 7 february 2003 i asked mr judd why awbs production of that document did not waive any privilege that subsisted in documents relating to the iron filings claim mr judds response was that the commonwealth did not put its case on that basis i do not think that is entirely correct in the particulars of its case the commonwealth contended that awbs disclosure of the masked version of the memorandum of 7 february 2003 worked a waiver of any privilege in documents relating to project water and the tigris transaction the commonwealth has never varied from the position that the iron filings claim was an integral part of the tigris transaction however the commonwealth did not in its closing address make any submission that privilege over the six documents had been waived by the production of the unmasked memorandum to that extent mr judds response was correct despite these matters i have concluded that the court cannot ignore the effect of the evidence before it especially as awb is seeking a declaration that the 10 documents are privileged conclusions it is not feasible in these reasons for judgment when so many documents are at issue to set out separate reasons for the decision i have reached on each particular document i have reached the conclusions set forth hereunder after inspecting all of the documents in awbs revised list of privileged documents and by applying the legal principles and factual findings identified above awb has not made out its claim for privilege in respect of the following documents 229 245247 279 280 362b 469a 495 542 565 586 675 784 867 872 890an 1090 1091 1095 1096 1098 1099 1118 and 1262 these documents fall into the following categories a documents for which there is no evidence of purpose to satisfy the dominant purpose test documents 229 469a 542 and 565 b documents where the evidence does not satisfy the dominant purpose test having regard to the nature and content of the document and the vague and formulaic evidence contained in the relevant segments of the affidavit evidence documents 279 280 495 675 784 867 872 890an 1095 1096 1098 1099 1118 and 1262 c a document that was provided to a third party and therefore was not a confidential communication for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice document 362b d documents which are partly not proven and partly waived documents 245247 586 1090 1091 which are discussed further below if contrary to my view privilege does attach to any of these documents there has been a waiver of privilege in respect of all of them other than documents 362b 784 872 and 1118 the waived documents are included in the list at 237 below in addition there are 10 documents relating to the iron filings claims they are as follows 30 31 32 32a 33 41 594 595 595a and 596 privilege does not attach to these documents as they were brought into existence in furtherance of a fraud or other impropriety alternatively any privilege has been waived by awb these documents are included in the list at 237 below awb has waived any legal professional privilege that subsisted in the following documents 12 30133 41 56 7779

1262 and 1297 in broad terms the documents over which privilege has been waived comprise documents falling within the following categories documents which define the scope of awbs internal review or which identify what investigations were carried out summaries chronologies and other documents which record or analyse the results of those investigations witness statements and other notes or records of interviews of awb personnel records of meetings and periodical reports concerning the findings of the review and documents seeking advice or comprising or recording advice provided to awb as to whether awb or any of its employees engaged in wrongdoing in connection with wheat sales to iraq under the off programme including any wrongdoing in connection with the tigris transaction as i have explained waiver does not turn on whether the documents attracted the description project rose or project water on inspection i determined that numerous documents marked re project rose or the equivalent fall outside the scope of any waiver as they related to distinct matters about which awb sought or obtained legal advice such as the powers and jurisdiction of the psi and iic investigators other us legal issues the memorandum of understanding between the iic and awb representation of awb employees at iic hearings the powers of the wheat export authority and issues of directors and officers insurance and corporate governance there are a number of documents where on inspection i have determined that the document is only capable of attracting privilege as to part the balance of the claim for privilege not having been proved but that such privilege has been waived these documents require some further explanation a documents 245 and 246 are drafts of an information paper dated 13 august 2004 document 247 substantially replicates the draft information paper in a power point presentation format awb claims privilege in two parts of each of these documents as indicated on the face of the documents in substance awb contended that these parts attracted privilege because they recorded legal advice on inspection i concluded that the claim is not established in respect of the first part of the documents i have determined that the second part claimed attracts privilege but awb has waived privilege in respect of that second part b document 586 is a table of various legal advices in the possession of blakes awb contended that the table recorded legal advice on inspection i concluded that this claim is not sustainable save for the entries listed at 23 24 and 25 of the table which disclose the substance of legal advice given by mr tracey qc i have determined that awb has waived privilege in respect of entries 23 24 and 25 of the table c documents 1090 and 1091 are respectively the minutes of awb and awbi board meetings dated 22 february 2005 awb claims privilege in two parts of each of these documents as indicated on the face of the documents it contended that these parts recorded legal advice as to the first part claimed this is not borne out by my inspection i have determined that the second part claimed attracts privilege but awb has waived privilege in respect of that second part there are also a number of documents which i have determined to be privileged only as to part of the claim made by awb after inspecting the documents and applying the principles i have discussed i have determined that certain parts of the documents are privileged while privilege in another part or parts of the documents has not been proved or it has been waived it is necessary to deal with each of these documents a document 138 contains three pages of handwritten file notes privilege has not been established in respect of the first page of the document if contrary to my view privilege is attracted it has been waived privilege is established in respect of the second page of the document privilege has not been established in respect of the third page of the document or if privilege is attracted contrary to my view it has been waived b document 251 is a document consisting of a number of entries in a spreadsheet awb claims privilege in certain parts of the document as indicated on the face of the document awb has waived privilege in respect of the parts claimed on pages 367 368 380 390 and the first of the two parts claimed on each of pages 388 and 395 the page numbering refers to the system that awb has adopted for its document control purposes otherwise the document attracts privilege to the extent claimed c document 376 is a handwritten file note headed iraq report for jis i have determined that the document attracts privilege but that awb has waived privilege in respect of the part of the document that relates to the tigris transaction namely the second entry commencing with the words completion of iraq mkt access arrangements and concluding with the words confirm there is compliance d documents 503 520 522 526 527 and 965 contain various drafts of a briefing paper initially prepared by abl i have determined that each of the documents attracts privilege but that awb has waived privilege in respect of the part of each document under the headings legal review and key messages e document 516 is another draft of the briefing paper referred to in the preceding subparagraph i have determined that the document attracts privilege but that awb has waived privilege in respect of the part of the document under the heading legal review f document 691 is a record of a meeting attended by various internal awb employees and external lawyers awb said that the document attracted privilege in part dr fuller gave evidence that it recorded legal advice of leonie thompson i have determined that the passage on page 028 of the document opposite the entry leonie t is privileged as to the remainder of the document it does not record any legal advice and is not privileged g document 696 is a record of a meeting attended by various internal awb employees and external lawyers awb claimed that the document was part privileged and relied on dr fullers evidence that it recorded legal advice given by leon zwier i have determined that the passage on page 037 of the document opposite the heading leon zwier to the balance of the page is privileged privilege has not been established in respect of the remainder of the document if any privilege attached to the remainder it has been waived h document 704s is a record of various matters discussed between awbs external and internal lawyers i have determined that awb has waived privilege over the six lines commencing with the entry which includes the words iron filings case the balance of the document is privileged i document 704ii is a handwritten record of various conversations on 20 and 28 september 2004 on the face of the document it appears that a claim for privilege is made only over the part of the document which is dated 28 september 2004 privilege has been established over the entry dated 28 september 2004 however the evidence of ms peavey in relation to document 704ii addresses the entry of 20 september 2004 if privilege is claimed over the part of the document which is dated 20 september 2004 it has not been established j document 1097 is the minutes of a meeting of the awb and awbi joint board committee there are two parts of the document over which a claim for privilege is made on the ground that they record legal advice on inspection i determined that the part of the document consisting of the first bullet point under the heading project rose is privileged however privilege has not been established over the third bullet point if privilege is attracted over that part of the document it has been waived document 1297 is a redacted copy of an email from cooper to lindberg and scales copied to quennell dated 16 november 2004 it appears that the redactions mask those parts of the document over which a claim for privilege is made prima facie the document appears to be within the scope of the waiver i have identified and applied in these reasons for judgment however i propose to invite further submissions from the parties as to whether document 1297 is in contest and if so i will direct that an unredacted version of the document be filed with the court for its inspection as for the remaining documents awb has in some instances claimed privilege over the entire document and in other instances it has only claimed privilege over a designated part or parts of the document awb has established that legal professional privilege attaches to the following documents to the extent claimed by it 20 21 55 8998 107 108 119 133 135 143146 150152 154160 162190 194 196 197 199201 204211a 215 217222 224228 230234

28 july 2002 each document in the list is a duplicate of an identified document in awbs list of privileged documents the duplicates fill 17 lever arch folders awb has sought a declaration that the documents in this list are or record confidential communications that are protected from production to the commissioner by legal professional privilege at the hearing neither awb nor the commonwealth directed any substantive submissions to the status of these duplicate documents in its written submissions awb referred to the principles enunciated in propend as to the circumstances in which a copy of an unprivileged document can itself attract legal professional privilege in those written submissions awb contended that the qualification which brennan cj expressed in propend at 512 does not represent the law the chief justices qualification was that if the original unprivileged document is not in existence or its location is not disclosed or it is not produced and if no unprivileged copy or other admissible evidence is available to prove the contents of the original document then privilege cannot be maintained over the copy however awb did not make any submissions as to how or why this qualification might be relevant to its claims awb adopted the position that the status of the duplicate documents depends on my decision as to the status of the corresponding original document the commonwealth did not make any submission to the contrary at the hearing although its written submissions contended that awb had failed to identify the purpose for which particular duplicates were created or to establish that they were kept confidential it would seem a harsh result if awb were to lose the benefit of privilege in original documents simply because it has not explained or is unable to explain the circumstances in which copies were made in large organisations and within law firms it is hardly unexpected that multiple copies of privileged documents will be brought into existence and that long after the event it may be difficult to adduce evidence as to the circumstances in which the copies were made the submissions of the parties were so cursory that i did not gain any meaningful assistance from them however i have reached the following conclusions where i have held that specified original documents do not attract legal professional privilege no case has been made out that duplicates of those documents are entitled to privilege where i have held that specified original documents attract legal professional privilege i have concluded that privilege attaches to the duplicates the duplicates come from the custody of awb and there is nothing to suggest that the duplicates were dealt with or communicated in ways that would deny the privilege claim furthermore the material before me does not identify any specific grounds for concluding that the duplicates do not attract privilege a number of documents in awbs revised list of privileged documents are said to be duplicates of other documents in the list there is no evidence as to some of those documents documents 291 307 and 580 and others have been removed documents 26 and 1031 consequently i have not made any findings about those documents it is unclear whether they remain in contest it is necessary to make specific reference to a number of other duplicate documents in the list a document 582 is a copy of document 140 i have determined that awb has waived any privilege attaching to the documents b document 998 is a copy of document 995 and document 1001 is a copy of part of document 1000 i have determined that the originals are privileged for the reasons given at 247 above privilege attaches to the copy documents c document 1006 is said by chesterman to be a copy of document 1005 my inspection of the documents has revealed that this is not the case there is therefore no evidence capable of supporting the claim for privilege in respect of document 1006 however even if there were evidence that document 1006 attracted privilege i am satisfied that awb has waived the privilege relief i have determined that specified documents are not the subject of legal professional privilege and that other documents attract legal professional privilege the court has power to make declarations to this effect i propose to give awb and the commonwealth an opportunity to make submissions as to the form of any declarations that should be made to give effect to these reasons for judgment awbs second further amended application also sought declarations relating to the construction and validity of the amending act in addition awb sought a declaration that the exercise of powers by the commissioner under s 6aa2 of the rca while these proceedings are pending before this court would constitute a contempt of court and injunctions restraining the commissioner from making a decision under s 6aa2 of the rca no live issues arise concerning these claims for relief see awb ltd v honourable terence rhoderic hudson cole no 2 2006 fca 913 neither awb nor the commonwealth put any submissions to me whether orally or in writing concerning these claims for relief it is unnecessary to address them further accordingly the only orders i propose to make at this stage are as follows 1 within 3 business days awb and the commonwealth file an agreed minute of orders that give effect to these reasons for judgment if awb and the commonwealth are unable to agree upon appropriate orders within 3 business days awb and the commonwealth shall each file and serve a minute of

govern pleadings in this court and the relevant authorities are conveniently summarised by weinberg j in mckellar v container terminal management services ltd 1999 fca 1101 1999 165 alr 409 at 415421 it is not necessary to restate at length his honours exposition of the relevant rules and the statements of principle which emerge from the cases to which he refers it is sufficient for present

413 at 417 whether or not such a pleading should be struck out will depend on whether or not the facts are pleaded at too great a level of generality see kernel holdings pty ltd v rothmans of pall mall australia pty ltd 1991 fca 557 32 section 33h of the fca act requires that any application commencing a representative proceeding must identify the group members to whom the proceeding relates specify the nature of the claims made on behalf of the group and specify the questions of law or fact common to the claims of the group members by s 33c of the act it is required that seven or more persons have claims against the same respondent that the claims arise out of the same or similar or related circumstances and that the claims of all group members give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact 33 as defined the group in the present proceeding includes persons who have dealt directly with one or more of the respondents in relation to the provision of international airfreight services it also includes persons who have had no such direct dealing but who have paid more than 20000 for such services during the relevant period the pleadings in paragraphs 85 and 86 suggest that within the defined group there are two further subgroups those members who have both paid for and acquired international airfreight services and those who have merely paid for those services as will be seen these are not mere semantic objections they give rise to the potential for confusion and in turn to embarrassment and prejudice 34 before turning to the substantial difficulties to which the imprecision of the definition of the group gives rise it is to be observed that there are insufficient material facts pleaded to establish that the applicant is a member of the defined group which it seeks to represent no attempt is made to establish other than by conclusionary statement in paragraph 85 that the applicant acquired or paid for any international airfreight services in australia or anywhere else during the relevant period when read together ss 33c and 33h of the fca act require that an applicant in a representative proceeding must be a person who shares with group members the same identifying criteria 45 the fuel surcharge is dealt with in paragraphs 29 to 55 of the sasc in paragraph 54 it is pleaded that the respondents and each of them engaged in the conduct alleged in paragraph sic 3151 in paragraph 55 it is alleged that by doing so the respondents and each of them gave effect to the global cartel arrangement or the subsidiary fuel surcharge arrangement in paragraph 87b it is alleged that all respondents are jointly and severally liable for all loss and damage caused by the imposition of the fuel surcharge 46 when however one examines paragraphs 31 to 51 one finds that paragraphs 31 to 36 deal exclusively with the conduct of lufthansa paragraphs 4145 deal exclusively with the conduct of british airways and paragraphs 4650 deal exclusively with the conduct of japan airlines in paragraph 37 it is alleged that all respondents other than lufthansa introduced fuel surcharges at agreed levels in february 2000 no particulars of this agreement are provided nor are the agreed levels identified 47 the warrisk surcharge is dealt with in paragraphs 64 to 70 of the sasc the parties to the arrangement pursuant to which the warrisk surcharge was imposed are identified in each of these paragraphs as being lufthansa singapore airlines and british airways it is not pleaded that qantas cathay pacific air new zealand or japan airlines were party to the arrangement or gave effect to it 48 despite this paragraph 87d pleads that all respondents are jointly and severally liable for all loss and damage caused by the imposition of the warrisk surcharge arrangement 49 the applicant seeks to meet the respondents objections to these parts of the sasc by contending that all respondents are liable for any damages occasioned by the imposition of any surcharge because they were all parties to the overarching global cartel arrangement that overarching arrangement is said in paragraph 26 to be an agreement to meet and discuss the fixing of prices for the carriage of international airfreight and to conceal any resulting pricefixing arrangements the surcharges are said to have been agreed upon in the course of meetings and discussions held under the overarching arrangement this arrangement contemplated that any agreed fixing of prices would emerge from further discussions among the respondents or some of them in the case of the warrisk surcharge not all respondents are alleged to have agreed to impose the surcharge or to have given effect to such an agreement their participation in the making of the global cartel arrangement without more cannot render those respondents which were not involved in the making and implementing of the warrisk surcharge agreement jointly and severally liable for damages arising from the imposition of that surcharge 50 these parts of the sasc are internally inconsistent confusing and embarrassing

raised by mr rhodes by way of challenge to the exercise by afma of its power of cancellation of mr rhodes fishing permit for reasons of socalled nonpayment of fees or levies it was acknowledged that in determining the scope of the obligation of natural justice the statutory framework is of crucial importance i was referred by mr rhodes to the high court decision of mobil oil australia pty ltd v federal commissioner of taxation 1963 hca 41 1963 113 clr 475 where in the reasons for judgment of kitto j at 5024 his honour considered whether the taxation board of review was legally bound to conform to the principles of natural justice in dealing with a reference in a case under s 136 kitto j made the prefatory observations that a legal obligation so to act arises in respect of many statutory powers there being no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry and every kind of tribunal but what the law requires in the discharge of a quasijudicial function is judicial fairness which is not a label for any fixed body of rules and what is fair in a given situation depends upon the circumstances the statutory context of the then income tax and social services contribution assessment act 19361958 cth which was of course in focus in mobil oil is significantly removed from that of the management act mr rhodes sought support additionally for the operation in principle of the rules as to natural justice from the dictum of brennan j in national companies and securities commission v news corporation ltd 1984 hca 29 1984 156 clr 296 at 326 where his honour observed as follows the limits of a statutory function are ascertained the interests which are apt to be affected by the performance of the function can be identified then it is possible for a court to say in the absence of express statutory provision what has to be done to be fair to those whose interests are apt to be affected by the performance of the function the terms of the statute which creates the function the nature of the function and the administrative framework in which the statute requires the function to be performed are material factors in determining what must be done to satisfy the requirements of natural justice those considerations render formidable the task of establishing the operation of the rules of natural justice in the present statutory context where the basis for prospective qualification would be the same for all applicants that being the holding of an existing shark permit conditional of course upon payment of the permit fee or levy

18515,70,23,450,246,41764,there is now a considerable body of authority dealing with this provision although its proper application is not altogether free from difficulty the first matter to emphasise about the exception in subs 3 is that it applies not to a document as such but to a representation or representations contained in a document it is well accepted that the hearsay rule contained in s 692 is founded on the rationale of reliability of business records generally the exception to that subsection is founded on a rationale of unreliability of representations made in the circumstances envisaged by subs 3 see generally australian competition and consumer commission v advanced medical institute pty ltd 2005 fca 1357 2005 147 fcr 235 at 27 as barrett j put the matter in vitali v stachnik 2001 nswsc 303 at 12 the purpose of the exclusion is to prevent the introduction through this exception to the hearsay rule of hearsay material which is prepared in an atmosphere or context which may cause it to be selfserving in the sense of possibly being prepared to assist the proof of something known or at least apprehended to be relevant to the outcome of identifiable legal proceedings 10 the focus of the contemplation referred to in subs 3a is as lindgren j indicated in the advanced medical institute case upon the contemplation of the person who prepared or obtained the relevant representation as his honour said at 2527 25 in order for s 693a to apply a person must have prepared or obtained the representation not the document in contemplation of a proceeding it is an unusual use of language to refer to the preparing of a representation but i think that the intention is clear enough the reference is to the person who prepared formulated shaped or framed the terms in which the representation is made this will typically perhaps always be or include the maker of the representation 26 the person who obtains a representation is a person who seeks the representation or procures it to be made this person is not the maker of the representation but may be a person who prepared it 27 by referring to persons who prepared or obtained the representation the legislature was attempting to encompass all those who might cause a representation to be made in the form which it takes
3000,92,4,287,227,9359,the onus of proof is on the land council which must satisfy the legal burden on the balance of probabilities but there is no reason to conclude that if the land council establishes a prima facie case of no native title there is no onus on worimi to adduce any evidence in support of his assertion of native title in dealing with the defensive use of native title in kokatha people v state of south australia 2007 fca 1057 finn j observed at 52 that a nonapplicant native title claimant who is unable to obtain authorisation to make a s 61 claim stands in no different position than any person who claims native title but is unable to institute proceedings to have that claim established 52 if the elements of native title are established by a nonapplicant claimant it can prevent a determination that native title does not exist although it cannot secure a positive determination of native title under s 225 of the act kokatha at 50 per finn j however worimis evidence may be sufficient to raise a doubt as to the nonexistence of native title without amounting to proof necessary for a claimant application or for a finding that native title exists 88 in relation to the nonclaimant application for a determination that no native title exists over the land the following seems to me to apply 8226 the act permits the making of nonclaimant applications for determinations that no native title exists over land 8226 this allows people with interests in land to ascertain whether native title exists the act envisages that determinations of the absence of native title may be made and provides a statutory guarantee of validity to future acts s 24fa section 611 provides for nonclaimant applications for native title determinations there is no indication in the act that there is a presumption that native title exists that must be displaced by an applicant seeking a determination of the absence of native title 8226 the minister has not abandoned his right to participate in these proceedings the minister has an interest in these proceedings namely to ensure that if the court is not satisfied that there is no native title over the land that the court does not make findings in relation to matters which would need to be addressed in making a positive determination of native title the minister also has an interest in knowing whether or not and in what way the crowns radical title is burdened by native title rights and interests in any event the act does not require the minister to establish an interest in order to be party to these proceedings 8226 these proceedings do not enable worimi to obtain a declaration that native title exists in order to establish that native title exists it is necessary to make an application under the act and to comply with the act and the requirements for the establishment of native title kokatha clifton worimi 2007 8226 an applicant for a determination of the absence of native title has an onus to establish that there is no native title over the land that onus applies to a civil standard the applicant must demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that native title does not exist 8226 there is no indication in the nsw act or the act to indicate that the standard to be applied is other than the ordinary civil standard 8226 a respondent to the application may adduce evidence to cast doubt on the applicants case as i said in worimi 2007 at 35 worimi would need to advance a case that establishes that native title does exist or to cast doubt on the land councils evidence worimis assertion of his native title rights and interests may lead to a more informed decision in the nonclaimant application worimi 2007 at 30 8226 the decision is based upon the whole of the evidence before the court including evidence adduced by worimi 8226 the evidence adduced by worimi should be assessed to determine whether it is sufficient to cast doubt on the land councils case such that the land council does not satisfy the court that on the balance of probabilities no native title exists over the land 8226 accordingly the onus is not on the land council to satisfy the court as to the absence of each element required to prove the existence of native title the land council is not required positively to establish the situation presovereignty and from sovereignty to the present time with expert evidence of laws and customs it is contrary to logic to say that a person who wishes to establish that there is no native title must first positively prove that there were laws and customs at any stage 8226 worimi is the person who asserts the existence of native title that necessarily means native title under the act the evidence must address the elements of such a claim in particular the laws and customs and rights and interests from presovereignty or the time of sovereignty to the present it is not necessary to prove each element of native title but the evidence should be sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements it does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist if the evidence establishes the absence of a necessary element of native title such as continuous connection with the land this would provide support for a determination of the absence of native title 8226 the land council may call evidence as to the existence or nonexistence of laws and customs at each of those stages and as to the existence of a class or persons claiming the communal group or individual rights the land council may establish that only one necessary element is missing such as continuous connection that would be sufficient to establish an absence of native title 8226 the subject matter of this application is the land constituted by a single lot lot 576 worimi contends that it is impossible to deal with lot 576 without also considering the surrounding land the land council has no obligation to demonstrate an absence of native title throughout the port stephens area the evidence needs to concern the land however evidence that relates to an area that goes beyond a recently subdivided lot is likely to be relevant the question remains however whether there are native title rights and interests over lot 576 8226 it is not in dispute that all formal requirements for a nonclaimant application for a determination of the absence of native title have been met in the absence of any evidence as to the existence of native title over the land the land council would be entitled to the determination it seeks both the land council and worimi have adduced evidence addressing the existence of native title it is necessary to consider the whole of that evidence to ascertain whether the land council has established on the balance of probabilities that there is no native title or whether sufficient doubt has been cast on the land councils case

24757,77,23,226,120,25017,the ability to take such matters into account as past and present general conduct or indeed as past and present criminal conduct for the purposes of s 5016ci is dependent on a finding that conduct of that description has occurred in minister for immigration and ethnic affairs v baker 1997 73 fcr 187 a full court of this court held that it was not necessary for the purposes of taking such conduct into account for it to have resulted in a conviction however the full court concluded at 194 that the forerunner of s 5016c was concerned with a persons conduct either general conduct or conduct of a more particular kind described as criminal conduct it is not concerned with whether the conduct has had some temporal result such as the incurring of a conviction but with the light that the conduct throws on the actors character of course in the absence of a prosecution and conviction satisfaction that criminal conduct has occurred will not be attained on slight material see the interesting note by b robertson criminal allegations in civil cases 1991 107 lqr 194 in baker the full court also held that the tribunal may rely on both kinds of conduct both criminal conduct and general conduct in deciding whether a person fails the character test and need not anchor its decision in one of the matters mentioned in subparas i and ii a later amendment to the provisions has made this abundantly clear by the insertion of the words either or both of the following in s 5016c part 2 of direction no 21 sets out the considerations to which decisionmakers must have regard when if the noncitizen does not pass the character test exercising the discretion to decide whether or not the noncitizen should be permitted to enter or remain in australia paragraph 22 provides weight of considerations 22 the government is mindful of the need to balance a number of important factors in reaching a decision whether or not to refuse or cancel a visa in making such a decision a decisionmaker should have regard to three primary considerations and a number of other considerations the primary considerations are set out at paragraphs 23 216 and other considerations are set out at paragraphs 217 224 decisionmakers must have due regard to the importance placed by the government on the three primary considerations but should also adopt a balancing process which takes into account all relevant considerations reference was made to what deane j said in pochi at 685 the tribunal was bound as a matter of law to act on the basis that any conduct alleged against mr pochi which was relied upon as a basis for sustaining the deportation order should be established on the balance of probability to its satisfaction by some rationally probative evidence and not merely raised before it as a matter of suspicion or speculation and to the full court in baker that satisfaction that criminal conduct has occurred will not be attained on slight material the minister submitted that there is no basis to suggest that the tribunal did not apply a standard of balance of probabilities the real complaint according to the minister appears to be that the tribunal had regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports when finding that the applicant failed the character test in s 5016c as the tribunal found that the applicant failed the test in s 5016a any error in also finding that the applicant failed the test in s 5016c is irrelevant in any case there was no reason why the tribunal could not have regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports as it noted they indicated similar behaviour to that for which the applicant had been convicted 156 according to the minister there is no error in the tribunals statement at 168 169 that a substantial number of similar reports from a wide variety of different sources detailing similar conduct increases the probability that the overall picture is true this is perfectly rational reasoning in the circumstances of this case the weight to be attributed to particular evidence was a matter for the tribunal minister for aboriginal affairs v pekowallsend ltd 1986 hca 40 1986 162 clr 24 at 41 per mason j given the nature of the applicants convictions there was no reason why the tribunal could not also have regard to other evidence of similar behaviour by the applicant when considering s 5016c in the circumstances of this case the tribunal was not finding criminal conduct in the absence of a conviction on slight material as cautioned against in baker at 194c it was finding that the applicant failed to satisfy the character tests in s 5016a and c on the basis of the evidence 169 which included the applicants criminal convictions as well as the housing department records and police intelligence reports as criminal conduct and general conduct are not a dichotomy and may overlap the minister submitted that it was perfectly appropriate for the tribunal to consider both together wong v minister for immigration amp multicultural amp indigenous affairs 2002 fcafc 440 at 33 35 it might be otherwise if there were no convictions and there was a finding that the applicant failed to satisfy the character test under s 5016ci and ii by recourse only to the police intelligence reports and the housing department records in that context the caution that came out of baker referred to in 82 above that there should not be a finding of criminal conduct on slight material may well be apt but that is not this case the only real issue in the context of this case was whether the tribunal acted capriciously in taking into account conduct referred to in the police intelligence reports and the housing department records of a kind similar to the conduct which constituted offences for which the applicant had been convicted ngaronoa jacobson j at 60 clearly it did not and unsurprisingly there was no suggestion or submission that it did this ground cannot sustain the application for review the applicant submitted that the tribunal erred in finding that the applicant failed the character test under ss 5016ci andor 5016cii of the act by taking into account the police intelligence reports and the housing department records concerning the applicant because in doing so it took into account irrelevant considerations those reports and records went into evidence it was not articulated why the matters contained in them were irrelevant considerations to which the tribunal could not have regard particularly when they showed a continuing pattern of similar behaviour similar to the behaviour constituting the offences upon which the convictions were based and paint a similar picture there is certainly no prohibition in the act express or implied against taking such considerations into account the weight to be attached to them is a different matter it is a matter for the tribunal not for this court on review of the tribunals decision in my view this ground has no merit and cannot sustain the application for review

7172,9,12,310,197,43410,another matter relevant to insolvency is the prospect of funds likely to be available from a third party such as from a capital injection or a subordinated loan the court will generally be sceptical of a mere assertion of a third partys willingness to provide such support such asserted willingness should be cogently demonstrated as a matter of commercial reality even if the evidence falls short of establishing a legal obligation to advance funds see the discussion in lewis v doran 2004 nswsc 608 2004 208 alr 385 per palmer j at 112 113 that topic too was a matter upon which there was some difference between the parties but for reasons which are discussed below i do not think it is significant in this instance because there is so little evidence of any real prospect of any third party capital funding becoming available in the end result senior counsel for the creditor did not place much weight on the prospect of an externally sourced capital injection of funds to show whether damilock was insolvent prior to about 12 february 2007 22 as i indicated mr lewis conclusion was that damilock was insolvent from at least early december 2006 and certainly by 26 december 2006 and remained insolvent until 26 june 2007 he expressed that view because in the whole of that period damilock had a deficiency in its cash flow needed to pay its debts which had become due and payable based upon hypothetical bank balance assessments which he had prepared he recognised that conclusion was based upon an assumption that damilocks creditors were paid on 30 day terms on that basis he concluded that damilock would have required an increase in its overdraft facility in excess of 6m increasing perhaps to 8m plus by 26 june 2007 to meet its debts as and when they fell due during that period he did alternative calculations based upon creditor payment terms of 60 and 90 days they did not alter his conclusion albeit that the increased overdraft facility required would have been considerably less he also concluded on his balance sheet analysis that damilock had a material deficiency in its working capital of 528000 as at 31 december 2006 increasing to 4896000 at 30 june 2007 and that those figures were conservative as they did not take account of noncurrent employee entitlements such as long service leave and depreciation 23 mr keiths view was that damilock was not insolvent prior to 12 february 2007 and became insolvent some time between that date and 14 march 2007 he identified the reasons for his conclusion differing from that of mr lewis as being 1 damilock was in ongoing discussions with potential equity investors at least in the period up to 12 february 2007 2 damilock had achieved a large net profit of 530000 in january 2007 so as to have given damilocks directors reason to expect that at that time its profitability and cash flow was improving significantly 3 damilock had engaged korda mentha highly regarded reconstruction and insolvency experts and 4 a report prepared by korda mentha as at 13 february 2007 did not state or express the opinion that damilock was then insolvent but indicated that korda mentha were in discussions with damilocks directors so that damilock was pursuing strategies to preserve the integrity of the continuing business
852,78,10,436,1,47468,since writing these reasons for judgment i have become aware of the judgment of the full court in minister for immigration amp multicultural affairs v lay lat 2006 fcafc 61 that judgment deals with an appeal by the minister from a judgment of the federal magistrates court which quashed a decision of a delegate of the minister to refuse a business skills migrant visa to the respondent to the appeal a person who had applied from outside australia for that visa the issue was whether the respondent had been denied what the full court called common law procedural fairness because the decisionmaker did not draw to the respondents attention the point on which the decision against him turned if the respondent were entitled to succeed on that issue there was then an issue as to whether a right to procedural fairness was excluded by s 51a of the migration act a provision in terms similar to both s 357a and s 422b but relating to decisions by the minister or delegates of the minister at 46 59 the full court held that there had been no denial of procedural fairness because the relevant point was obvious to the respondent the full court then proceeded at 60 70 to make some observations which are clearly obiter on the effect of s 51a following vxdc v minister for immigration amp multicultural amp indigenous affairs 2005 fca 1388 2005 146 fcr 562 the full court expressed the view that s 51a operates to exclude the common law natural justice hearing rule altogether 97 to the extent to which lay lat might be taken to be authority on the meaning and effect of s 357a of the migration act it does not bind me to hold that ms antipovas only entitlement to procedural fairness is to be found in the meagre provisions of div 5 of pt 5 of the migration act in my view to the extent that it suggests that s 422b excludes all principles of procedural fairness other than those found in div 4 of pt 7 of the migration act vxdc is fundamentally wrong the obiter remarks in lay lat are entitled to great respect appearing as they do in a considered judgment of a full court but i cannot bring myself to accept that they are correct for the reasons i gave in moradian v minister for immigration amp multicultural amp indigenous affairs 2004 fca 1590 2004 142 fcr 170 at 28 i remain of the view that the words in relation to the matters it deals with appearing in each of ss 51a 357a and 422b of the migration act are intended to qualify the words preceding them and to reduce what would otherwise be the absolute effect of those exclusionary words if this were not the case the words in relation to the matters it deals with would be otiose and it is not to be supposed that parliament intended to enact meaningless surplus words in a crucial amendment the words are not the plain words of necessary intendment required to exclude the requirements of procedural fairness see annetts v mccann 1990 hca 57 1990 170 clr 596 at 598 per mason cj deane and mchugh jj and the authorities there cited it is highly unlikely that parliament had in mind all of the myriad ways in which procedural fairness a concept the content of which is dependent on the circumstances of each case could arise the present case forms a good example of what would result if the view expressed in lay lat were to be followed assuming that s 3601 of the migration act does not have the meaning that it has in my view the tribunal could reduce the time of a hearing arbitrarily as much as it chose interrupt and curtail the evidence of the applicant constantly and deprive the applicant of any opportunity to put his or her case and the applicant would have no redress it is impossible to imagine that parliament intended such a drastic result 98 to the extent to which the views expressed in vxdc and lay lat are said to be based on a reading of the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech relating to the bill by which ss 51a 357a and 422b were introduced into the migration act i repeat the view i expressed in moradian at 35 those documents do not contain statements specific enough to resolve any ambiguity in those provisions or to disclose a purpose specific enough to warrant a construction of the provisions that would regard them as excluding the entirety of the principle of procedural fairness described as the natural justice hearing rule 99 for these reasons if it is necessary to ask the question whether ms antipova is entitled to succeed on the basis that the tribunal denied her procedural fairness by the manner in which it conducted her hearing i do not regard vxdc and lay lat as requiring me to take a view different from that i have expressed above

people was based on matrilineal descent from the apical ancestors james crowe and maggie palmer whereas membership of the kabi kabi people was based on cognatic descent from a number of apical

reaching of a consensus decision by the elders of the respective family groups within the clan without recourse to a majority vote of the group as adopted by the kabi kabi people when purporting to authorise the ilua c there was no evidence from which the first respondent could reasonably be satisfied that the gubbi gubbi people did not adhere to a mandatory traditional decision making process as aforesaid d the first respondent failed to take into consideration the fact that the gubbi gubbi people both before and at the authorisation meeting disputed the decision making process adopted at the authorisation meeting and did not authorise the making of the ilua e the first respondent concluded that there was no mandatory traditional decision making process applicable to the subject decision in reliance upon evidence that emanated from persons who where no traditional custodians of such information f there was no evidence from which the first respondent could reasonably have concluded that the gubbi gubbi people withdrew from the agreement making process g the evidence showed that the gubbi gubbi people were not afforded the opportunity to separately consider the terms of the ilua in accordance with the their mandatory traditional decision making process in circumstances where the persons said to hold native title where encompassed by three separately represented

the ilua was invalid either in whole or in part and was thereby no an area agreement capable of being registered d failing to find that the chima component of the ilua in so far as it dealt with the regulation of cultural heritage matters over land where native title rights had been extinguished was no properly the subject matter of an area agreement pursuant to section 24cb of the native title act and thereby the ilua was not an area agreement capable of being registered particulars a the chima regulates aboriginal cultural heritage matters as defined in the acha over areas where native title rights have been extinguished and b to the extent that the ilua deal with areas where native title rights have been extinguished i the aboriginal party under the acha ought to have been a party to the ilua as required by section 233aiii of the acha ii the aboriginal ilua parties did not have standing under the native title act to enter into ilua which purported to regulate aboriginal cultural heritage matters over such areas and iii it is not competent for an ilua to deal with cultural heritage maters properly regulated by existing state legislation over land where native title rights do not exist

3784,77,4,286,272,44336,the question whether leave to appeal should be granted falls to be determined according to the criteria set down by the full court in deacutecor corporation pty ltd v dart industries inc 1991 33 fcr 397 first whether the impugned decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration secondly whether substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted supposing that the impugned decision was wrong 21 the applicant by his submissions contends that 9 the proposition that the second respondent andor mr ariss could have been expected to contend for if present before the federal magistrates court namely that they or one of them was the true owner of the jewellery was clearly articulated as was the basis upon which they might seek to rely to establish such a claim a there was express disclosure that the second respondent and mr ariss were persons named as insureds in relation to the jewellery b there was express disclosure that the bankrupt gave evidence that when she asked her husband ie mr ariss for the jewellery he said the jewellery was the property of the second respondent and that she could not have it c there was express disclosure that when the husband had been examined pursuant to s81 of the bankruptcy act he asserted that he had given certain items of the jewellery to one or both of this daughters consistent with ownership of the jewellery by him or the second respondent d there was express disclosure that the bankrupt expressed the opinion that some of the house contents the subject of the same policy of insurance might be owned by the second respondent although like the jewellery such items of contents were not disclosed as an asset in the balance sheet of the second respondent 10 in order to determine whether or not there was material nondisclosure it is necessary to have regard to the evidence of the bankrupt as a whole it is asserted that the fact she had earlier given evidence contrary to the proposition the jewellery was hers was not disclosed what the transcript of the evidence given by the bankrupt on 22 december 2005 discloses is that she did on occasion give contrary evidence that is on occasion she gave evidence that she thought that the jewellery was either that of mr ariss or the second respondent however what is critical is that she was examined as to why she might hold to that view she said in evidence that she held that view for two reasons namely a because those persons were named as insureds in relation to the jewellery and b her husband had told her that the jewellery was the property of the second respondent or of himself both considerations which had led the bankrupt to on occasion state that the jewellery might be the property of the second respondent or of mr ariss were disclosed on the ex parte application as was the fact there was evidence consistent with such potential claims 11 the cases establish that on an application made ex parte there must be disclosure of material facts the material facts which were required to be disclosed here were a that the second respondent and mr ariss were persons who were named as persons having an insured interest in relation to the jewellery this was disclosed in the king affidavit and the relevant insurance documents were exhibited b that mr ariss currently the sole director of the second respondent held the view that the jewellery in question was either his or the second respondents this was also disclosed 12 the best evidence that mr ariss andor the second respondent would claim to be the owners of the jewellery and the basis of that claim was before the federal magistrates court there was direct evidence of which the court was informed that mr ariss asserted the jewellery was his or the second respondents and on that basis refused to return it to his wife in those circumstances the fact there was additional evidence from the bankrupt that on the basis of the insureds interest and on the basis of what her husband told her she believed that the jewellery may be his or the second respondents jewellery was not material 17 the king affidavit disclosed that the second respondent or mr ariss would assert an entitlement to the jewellery the magistrate knew that was the case they would make and knew there was documentary evidence in support of that case at least as to an arguable insurable interest notwithstanding none of the jewellery appeared on the balance sheet of the second respondent 28 the magistrates decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration i do not think it necessary to go on to consider whether substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted supposing that the magistrates decision was wrong the two limbs of the test in deacutecor corporation cannot be considered in isolation from one another see deacutecor corporation at 398399 the prospect that an appeal if leave were granted would be successful is so remote that it would be artificial to suppose that the decision below is wrong see applicant vmao v minister for immigration amp multicultural amp indigenous affairs 2005 fca

4455,31,22,159,85,9758,the applicant acknowledges that there is no false and wilful misrepresentation to the effect that he did not suffer and had not previously suffered from a degenerative condition in his left knee that is the disease specifically which the tribunal found had been aggravated by the respondents employment with the applicant the respondents evidence was that he had previously had trouble with his left knee in 2002 when he had been learning to drive a truck with a heavy clutch but that the problem had resolved following physiotherapy it was not contended by the applicant that that circumstance was sufficient to have obliged the respondent by reason of s 107 to have disclosed specifically the previously degenerative condition of his left knee because it is now shown that he was aware of it it is not a circumstance where the respondent failed to disclose a symptom of a disease in the left knee in circumstances where it ought to have been disclosed as distinct from the suffering of a particular and temporary injury cf re schofield and comcare 1995 38 ald 124 70 the medical evidence indicated that the respondent had an underlying degenerative condition of both his knees but does not firmly indicate that those degenerative conditions were related or that the incapacity caused by aggravation of the degenerative condition in the left knee was related to the degenerative condition in the right knee reference need only be made to the report of dr bauze of 12 september 2005 and of the respondents general practitioner dr chambers in his report of 19 october 2005 discussed in the tribunals reasons 71 the applicant submitted that the relationship between degenerative conditions in knees is hardly controversial that may or may not be correct as a matter of general medical science but it does not address the particular findings of fact or the particular evidence in this case as its contentions indicate there was some medical evidence considering the relationship between the degenerative conditions of the respondents right knee and his left knee the issue was not fully explored because in the particular circumstances it was not a matter upon which the tribunal was required to make or made a finding favourable to the contention of the applicant it merely found that the respondent had a degenerative condition of his left knee which had been aggravated by his employment with the applicant leading to incapacity for work that state of the evidence does not enable me to make any finding on the issue as potentially authorised by s 447 of the administrative appeals tribunal act 1975 cth 72 in those circumstances in my judgment the applicant has not shown in any event that the respondent made a wilful and false representation that he did not suffer or had not previously suffered from a degenerative condition in his left knee or had not suffered and did not suffer from the aggravation of that condition when he applied for his cmf or subsequently in this particular case the tribunal did not make the finding upon which the applicants contention is premised and in fact did not find that the degenerative conditions in the applicants right and left knees were a single ailment and should therefore be treated as a single disease it made a different finding the finding was open to it 73 consequently the condition upon which s 107 would operate as a matter of fact to disentitle the applicant from compensation under the seafarers act has not been shown by the applicant to have been made out and indeed its premise is inconsistent with the finding which the tribunal in fact made
20944,9,36,108,37,25413,honour observed at 24 that it was common ground that the phrase juices of fruits does not have a trade meaning at 36 he referred to what was said by a full court of this court in zeroz pty ltd v deputy commissioner of taxation 1997 35 atr 349 at 357 if there is no trade usage then a fortiori the expression must be used in its ordinary english sense but p amp n in that case like the applicant in this case made a number of submissions which at the risk of doing the applicant a disservice went something like this 1 while the phrase juices of fruits does not have a trade meaning the phrase is synonymous with fruit juice and that term had a trade meaning as defined in the food standards code the food standards code is a reference to the australia new zealand food standards code as defined in the food standards australia new zealand act 1991 cth the food standards code standard 261 with respect to fruit juice and vegetable juice defined fruit juice or vegetable juice as the liquid portion with or without pulp obtained from fruit or vegetables respectively and in the case of citrus fruit other than lime the endocarp only of the fruit and included products that had been concentrated and later reconstituted with water to a concentration consistent with that of the undiluted juice from which it had been made at 21 and 22 his honour observed that it was common ground that the fruit drinks supplied by p amp n met the food standards code requirements it was also common ground that p amp n fruit drinks contained nonfruit based additives vitamins and minerals or used processing aids within the limits permitted by the food standards code the evidence was that the fruit drinks contained 98 99 fruit juice and 1 2 additives and processing aids not directly derived from fruit 2 in substituting a trade meaning of fruit juice for juices of fruits that has no trade meaning reliance was placed on collector of customs v agfagevaert ltd 1996 hca 36 1996 186 clr 389 where the phrase silver dye bleach reversal process in a tariff concession had no trade meaning but the words silver dye bleach process did the high court held that the tribunals construction of the composite phrase by reference to the trade meaning of the lesser phrase and the ordinary meaning of the word reversal involved no error of law the submission by parity of reasoning was that in the item 11 composite phrase wholly of juices of fruits the word wholly should be given its ordinary meaning and the words juices of fruits in both items 11 and 12 should be given the trade meaning for fruit juice 3 that having adopted the foods standards code prior to the introduction of the gst act its concepts were well known to the parliament and that it may be taken to have had regard to them in respect of a law dealing with the exemption of food as to the reliance on agfagevaert in substituting a trade meaning of fruit juice for juices of fruits his honour said at 27 agfagevaert is quite different from the instant circumstances the composite phrase was not one that had an obvious ordinary meaning nor did the lesser phrase in those circumstances the lesser phrase aided the proper interpretation of the composite one here the words that comprise the composite phrase are words of common parlance even if they are oddly arranged and there is not the same need to call in aid a trade meaning as to the submission that parliament may be taken to have adopted the food standards code and its trade meaning of fruit juice in respect of a law dealing with the exemption of food his honour said at 34 35 34 furthermore the extrinsic materials do not suggest that parliament adopted a trade meaning in the foods standards code if it had one would have expected it to have departed from the unusual phrase juices of fruits the extrinsic material makes it clear in my view that parliament intended to bring within the scope of the amendments to the gst act the exemptions or concessions in relation to food products under the existing sales tax legislation hence the adoption of the phraseology in item 11 35 parliament was invoking its past legislation rather than adopting a trade meaning of other words in an industry code that the past legislation preceded the harking back to a phrase used in the sales tax legislation in 1935 leads to the irresistible conclusion that parliament was carrying forward some of the exemptions and concessions with respect to food in the sales tax legislation and not attributing to the phrase any trade meaning of a different term in the foods standards code there was no logical reason for parliament in introducing a new tax to adopt a code intended to ensure that the public was protected from poorly prepared food the 2 objects are clearly distinct if parliament had intended to adopt the code one would have expected a collocation such as nonalcoholic carbonated beverages produced wholly in accordance with the foods standards code analysis relevant principles of statutory construction

from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case 1 the mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation r v trade practices tribunal ex

in the state superannuation board v trade practices commission 1982 hca 72 1982 150 clr 282 mason murphy and deane jj said at 303 the decision in adamson is of importance for two reasons first the majority of the court barwick cj mason jacobs and murphy jj rejecting the argument that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is the sole or principal criterion of its character as a trading corporation 148 this passage indicates that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is not the sole or principal criterion for the purposes of characterisation the passage suggests however that the purpose of the formation of a corporation is not irrelevant in that process 149 the contention for the applicant in both proceedings in this case is that when one looks at the totality of the evidence including the historical evidence concerning the function of the etheridge shire council in particular the fundamental functions of the shire council being the legislative and administrative responsibility as a local government for the local government area it is impossible to conclude that the etheridge shire council is a trading corporation 150 i have set out in detail the evidence in relation to what is said to be the trading activities of the council 151 all of them in my opinion including even the road works aspect of the activity of the council after close analysis entirely lack the essential quality of trade almost all of them run at a loss they are all directed in my view to public benefit objectives within the shire their scale even in monetary terms putting to one side the nonmonetary significance of the legislative and executive activity of the shire council are so inconsequential and incidental to the primary activity and function of the council as to the deny to the council the characterisation of a trading corporation or a financial corporation
11807,85,38,285,92,33318,the share account statements referred to in paragraph 47 of the affidavit of ian carey dated 5 november 2007 the respondents notice of motion seeking to set aside this notice to produce is that filed on 14 december 2007 2 also before the court is an oral application made by the respondent seeking to set aside a second notice to produce served by the applicants and dated 1 february 2008 that notice to produce seeks the production of advice from naomi sharp dated 20 december 2007 3 the first notice to produce dated 29 november 2007 invokes order 15a rule 6 of the federal court rules 1979 cth which provides as follows discovery from prospective respondent where a there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the court from a person whose description has been ascertained b after making all reasonable inquiries the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the court to obtain that relief and c there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision the court may order that that person shall make discovery to the applicant of any document of the kind described in paragraph c the present provision of relevance is paragraph c and the discretion conferred 4 argument this morning proceeded upon the basis that the success or failure of the motion could be tested by looking at the first document described in the notice to produce namely the statement of the two accounts the affidavit of ian carey referred to in the notice to produce being that sworn on 5 november 2007 provided in paragraph 10 as follows in january 2000 the deposit from the sale of the 37 carr street property after deduction of the agents commission of 120432 had been paid into my bank account at bank of melbourne by mistake this account was later closed and the funds transferred to another account of mine in australia 5 on behalf of the respondent it was submitted that rule 6c required a three stage progression namely 1 an inquiry as to whether there was reasonable cause to believe 2 whether there were any documents in the possession of his client or likely to have been in the possession of his client relating to the question of whether the applicants had a right to obtain the relief and 3 the exercise of the courts discretion that discretion being conferred by the phrase the court may order left to one side has been the resolution of any question as to whether compliance with previous orders of this court or noncompliance could contribute to the court forming a view that there was a reasonable cause to believe 6 for present purposes it was accepted by the respondent that the bank accounts referred to in paragraph 10 of the affidavit indicated that there were documents likely to have been in the possession of the respondent and that such documents could relat e to the question of whether the applicants had a right to obtain the relief attention on behalf of the respondent was thus focused upon the exercise of the courts discretion 7 considerable caution must be exercised in ordering the production of documents in circumstances where the application before the court is an order under order 15a of the federal court rules in smithkline beecham plc v alphapharm pty ltd 2001 fca 271 finkelstein j observed 19 o15a is designed to enable a person to determine whether he has a good cause of action against a prospective defendant it is not designed to secure for a prospective plaintiff all the documents and other information that would be discoverable if a proceeding were commenced against the defendant nevertheless some fishing must be permitted for otherwise there will be little scope for the operation of the rule speaking generally however once a person is in a position to make a decision whether he has a good or perhaps arguable cause of action the criteria to be satisfied before an order can be made under o15a r6 will not be satisfied 8 in the circumstances of the present case however it is considered that the applicants fall within the ambit of order 15a rule 6 and that the discretion should be exercised in their favour relevant to the exercise of the discretion is the potential importance of the documents which have been sought in the resolution of the question as to whether the applicants have a right to obtain relief the statements of the two accounts referred to in paragraph 10 of the respondents affidavit it is considered are of considerable potential importance 9 in the absence of any distinction being drawn between the documents identified in paragraph 1 as opposed to the notice to produce generally it is thus considered that production should be ordered of all of those documents identified in paragraphs 1 7 of the first notice to produce 10 the second notice to produce dated 1 february 2008 seeks the production of an advice from naomi sharp of counsel
8220,80,1,64,52,7085,the meaning and implications of the statutory notion of decision where used in the adjr act was comprehensively explained by the high court in australian broadcasting tribunal v bond 1990 hca 33 1990 170 clr 321 it was emphasised by mason cj at 335 with whose reasons brennan j agreed as did deane j other than in relation to a particular matter not here material that such meaning must be determined by reference to the text scope and purpose of the legislation and further that the remedial nature of the adjr act indicates that no narrow view is to be taken of the notion of decision in that statutory context moreover his honour pointed out at 336 that the concept of a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorises rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision and further that the examples of a decision listed in the extended definition contained in s 32 of the adjr act are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality being an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application inquiry or dispute section 33 of the adjr act which extends the statutory definition of decision to the making of a report or recommendation before a decision is made in the exercise of a power was said by his honour to operate to qualify the characteristic of finality moreover the chief justice explained that acts done preparatory to the making of a decision are not to be regarded as constituting decisions for if they were there would be little if any point in providing for judicial review of conduct as well as of a decision 28 in the further course of his reasons for judgment in bond at 337 mason cj pointed out that a reviewable decision is one for which provision is made by or under a statute which will generally but not always entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative at least in a practical sense of the issue of fact falling for consideration so long of course that it be a substantive determination as opposed to procedural determinations 29 the applicants focused those explanations and expositions of the chief justice upon s 111 of the act which refers to power conferred upon the authority inter alia to revoke or vary any condition of a licence which it may have previously imposed and submitted that so much did not mean that a refusal to exercise any such positive power on the part of the authority did not constitute a decision made under s 111 it was pointed out in that regard in my opinion rightly that there are many statutes in which the decisionmaking power is expressed only in terms of a positive discretion without express reference to the power to make a decision of a negative character yet in such cases it is necessarily implicit that a negative decision would also be made under that provision otherwise so it was further emphasised by the present applicants paras a b and g of s 32 of the adjr act would be otiose those subsections read as follows the emphasis appearing in nonitalics is mine s 32 in this act a reference to the making of a decision includes a reference to a making suspending revoking or refusing to make an order award or determination b giving suspending revoking or refusing to give a certificate direction approval consent or permission g doing or refusing to do any other act or thing 31 the authority sought to deny any conclusion as to the existence of a justiciable decision by characterising its first decision as declining to even consider the exercise of any discretion under s 111 of the act in the applicants submission that purported characterisation was misconceived and must be rejected for the following reasons i the decision not to exercise its power under s 111 to vary a condition of the licence was indeed final operative and determinative in the practical sense described in bond and in right to life cedilla of auscoasts ability to continue to broadcast under the auspices of the 1620 licence from the current site at tingalpa ii any such characterisation sits at least uncomfortably with the terms of the authoritys letter of 30 june 2005 containing as it does the assertion as a result the authority will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the act and vary licence conditions in the terms proposed by wal iii the decision not to exercise the power was one which was authorised by and therefore made under s 111 of the act since s 111 confers a discretionary power and hence contemplates that a decision whether or not to exercise that discretion could be made there being no other source of power for such a decision i think that there is force in each of the foregoing submissions of the applicants 48 ryan j found that the minister there had not received advice from a local aboriginal community in accordance with s 21d1 and thus the issue of relevance was whether or not the ministers decision not to determinee on hisown motion that a temporary declaration of preservation should be made was a reviewable decision for the purposes of s 51 of the adjr act the minister had informed the applicants in writing that he would consider their request for a determination on his own motion but later told the applicants that he would not do so pending the resolution of another proceeding before this court involving the same artefacts his honour found that the ministers decision was a decision to decline to determineeon his own motion and was thus made preparatory to the making of a decision to determine to make a temporary declaration alternatively his honour characterised the decision declining to so determinee as a conclusion reached as a step on the way to an ultimate decision which is not reviewable for that reason also thereby referring to dicta to like effect at 337 of mason cjs reasons for judgment in bond 59 thus by way of reflection of the dictum i have cited from bond the communications of the authority as evidenced from the outset by its faxed response of 16 august 2004 to the applicants application of 6 august 2004 and thereafter inclusive of its critical communication to wal of 30 june 1995 the authority indicated to the applicants the position which it had adopted or taken as inherently and essentially indicative of decisionmaking on its part the same having for instance the character or quality of finality and constituting and involving an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application within the scope of that dictum of mason cj in bond i have earlier cited that communication of the authority constituted or involved a decision at least in a practical sense of the issue of fact falling for consideration it was a substantive determination as opposed to a procedural determination to adopt the chief justices further dictum in bond

4982,35,32,138,124,3187,noted above comandate marines proceedings in rem contained no such request and art 81 of the model law relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute 59 russell on arbitration 22 nd ed at 610 a5018 refers to art 81 having the same effect as english law ie the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings op cit at 296 7005 the position is similar under s 532 of the commercial arbitration act 1984 nsw which applies here by force of s 79 of the judiciary act 1903 cth comandate marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this court or the high court i am of opinion that comandate marines conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement and that art 81 and art 9 of the model law do not avail it comandate marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by parker j in matthews v smallwood 1910 1 ch at 786787 by pleading the writ in the way which it did comandate marine exercised a right of action given by the admiralty act 1988 cth to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 43f of the admiralty act 1988 cth in this court i am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the court comandate marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage it made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ the way in which comandate marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed notionally or actually to the mast of the boomerang i having invoked the jurisdiction of the court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded it is not open to comandate marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the admiralty act 1988 cth in its report civil admiralty jurisdiction report no 33 1986 law reform commission australia the commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere if the subject matter of the dispute lies within admiralty jurisdiction the commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied and hence that a just result would be obtained it noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made and in achieving cooperation between courts and arbitrators to this end however the commission desired in the solution it proposed that the court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits alrc 33 189 that discretion was to arise in the court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the commission noted that as at 1986 english and south african courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum the tuyuti 1984 qb 838 at 851 katagum wholesale commodities v the mv paz 1984 3 saf lr 261 at 268 270 natal provincial division of the supreme court of south africa neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in paal wilson amp co as v partenreederei hannah blumenthal 1983 1 ac 854 at 915916 there lord diplock considered that abandonment of a contract which was still executory involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches arising under the executory and now abandoned contract lord brandon of oakbrook who gave the leading speech see 1983 1 ac 900c per lord diplock said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact 1983 1 ac at 913f he continued 1983 1 ac at 914ac the concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law see chitty on contracts 23 rd ed 1968 vol 1 p 577 para 1231 and cases there cited where a seeks to prove that he and b have abandoned a contract in this way there are two ways in which a can put his case the first way is by showing that the conduct of each party as evinced to the other party and acted on by him leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract the second method is by showing that the conduct of b as evinced towards a has been such as to lead a reasonably to believe that b has abandoned the contract even though it has not in fact been bs intention to do so and that a has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief the first method involves actual abandonment by both a and b the second method involves the creation by b of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting as against a that he b has not abandoned the contract pearl mill co v ivy tannery co ltd 1919 1 kb 78 this contractual analysis is inapposite here but their lordships approach shows that notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed in international trade and commerce it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with in particular the new york convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the international arbitration act 1974 cth this is because in international trade and commerce the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute the parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute it is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45b invoking arbitration in london under english law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration including australia are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce however the court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45b rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties chosen method or place of dispute resolution refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and indeed local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains see eg vimar seguros y reaseguros sa v mv sky reefer 515 us 528 at 538 1995 mitsubishi motors corp v soler chryslerplymouth inc 473 us 614 638 1985 scherk v albertoculver co 417 us 506 516

at 541542 federal court of appeal but just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45b so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election when comandate marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings it may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way but it did not do so the english authorities on which comandate marine relied and to which sheppard j referred did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election for that reason i think those authorities are distinguishable because comandate marine elected to litigate the dispute and pan has too the arbitration agreement in cl 45b has been in substance abandoned or for the purposes of s 75 of the international arbitration act 1974 cth rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed was there an agreement in writing pan argues that art ii r 2 of the new york convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams pan says that where the contract was formed as it argues the charter party was in this case either by acts or conduct art ii r 2 is not satisfied pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence in support of the argument it relies on decision of the supreme court of italy in robobar limited v finncold sas 1995 year book comm arbn xx 739 at 740 the court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded there was no doubt that none of the formalities in art ii in the new york convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram pan also relied on a decision of the court of appeal of the federal republic of germany in a case between a dutch seller and a german buyer 1997 year book comm arbn vol ii 237 at 238 the court of appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required a one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that partys appearance in the arbitration in this matter however the critical telex of 20 april 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far the next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur i think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the supreme court of italy and the german court of appeal as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams and in zambia steel amp building supplies ltd v james clark amp eaton ltd 1986 2 lloyds rep 225 at 234 ralph gibson lj said it is clear to me that the new york convention by art ii par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document the manitoba court of appeal noted in proctor v schellenberg 2003 2 wwr 621 at 628 18 that art iv r 1b of the new york convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award to provide the original agreement referred to in article ii or a duly

sufficient to be or form part of an agreement in writing in aj van den bergs the new york arbitration convention of 1958 1981 at 196198 206 277 the learned author notes that art ii r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded at 197 227 that as at 1981 there had been only one exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with art ii r 2 that being a decision of the court of first instance of rotterdam the learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of art ii r 2 or the intent of its drafters and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised significantly he referred to the history of art ii r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the new york convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or

the defendant in writing assented to the agreement to arbitrate see at 12 it has been recognized that a national courts in the interest of uniformity should construe rules formulated by an international convention especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods in a normal manner appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention unconstrained by technical rules of english or domestic law or by english or domestic legal precedent but on broad principles of general acceptation

particularly the supreme courts of nations are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation and i am conscious that in s 31 of the international arbitration act 1974 cth the definition of arbitration agreement is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in art ii r 2 as a matter of construction under australian law i would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one however i think that the drafting of the definition in art ii r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams the precontractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or freestanding agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed it was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter and as capt piperakis said he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided the owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel on the evidence before me unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound that agreement which thus brought cl 45b into existence as an agreement to arbitrate was manifested by comandate marines conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel at common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier

doubt cl 45b was part of the agreement between pan and comandate marine but that does not of itself comply with art ii r 2 rather the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence so the contract being or including the arbitration agreement was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails the contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of art ii r 2 and because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of letters or telegrams including telexes or emails then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of art ii r 2 a contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer empirnall holdings pty limited v machon paull partners pty limited 1988 14

vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee for the reasons i have given based on the fairly settled interpretation of art ii r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient on the evidence i find that at the present time there is no agreement in writing for the purposes of art ii r 2 of the new york convention comandate marines alternative claim for stay under s 53 of the commercial arbitration act 1984 nsw comandate marine argued that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 72 of the international arbitration act 1974 cth were not found i should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the commercial arbitration act 1984 nsw the commercial arbitration act 1984 nsw provides that an arbitration agreement means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration see s 41 by s 531 the court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration having regard to the fact that comandate marine commenced its proceedings in rem as i have found without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings i am of opinion that the evidence establishes that comandate marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration however its application for stay is made in pans proceedings at the time when pans proceedings were commenced comandate marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now i do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant by s 532 the leave of the court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance although comandate marines proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings they form as i have held part of the same matter for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the constitution and i am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of comandate marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which i have found scope of the arbitration clause comandate marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51a 52 and 55a of the trade practices act 1974 cth and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87 including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing comandate marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were colourable it was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the court rather it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the admiralty act 1988 cth because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the trade practices act 1974 cth were in essence the same as the breaches of contract relied on by pan comandate marine in written submissions asserted that the trade practices act 1974 cth claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction i do not think this argument has any substance part v of the trade practices act 1974 cth in which s 52 is found sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce the task of the court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in travel compensation fund v tambree 2005 hca 69 2005 80 aljr 183

common law principles relating to passingoff if as i consider the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law the statute provides an additional remedy emphasis added i am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction the parliament of the commonwealth has enacted the trade practices act 1974 cth under the trade and commerce power in s 51i of the constitution there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that pan has not properly and regularly invoked the courts jurisdiction pans pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not comandate marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct i am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the court has been asked to quell cf dorta ekenaike v victorian legal aid 2005 hca 12 2005 79 aljr 755 at 761 32 the only arguable limitation in the admiralty act 1988 cth which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that act is to be found in s 13 but on examination s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court including this court has from sources other than the admiralty act 1988 cth itself rather s 13 provides that the act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii or iii of the constitution in ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the federal court may exercise s 13 thus provides some guidance it contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76ii and iii of the constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the court section 76iii of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is a clear source of power to enact the admiralty act 1988 cth itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12 and s 76ii provides that the judicial power of the commonwealth is invoked in any matter arising under any laws made by the parliament the purpose of s 13 is to limit in the construction of the act the conferral of jurisdiction by the act to matters within the power of the parliament and the judicial power of the commonwealth it is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the act confers or invests jurisdiction clearly enough s 86 of the trade practices act 1974 cth is a law made by the parliament which confers jurisdiction on this court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the admiralty act 1988 cth it is quite inappropriate to read

judgment of a relevant person defined by s 31 as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property the section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it next comandate marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the admiralty act 1988 cth or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that act here part of the matter within the meaning of ss 76ii and iii of the constitution is the controversy between the parties under the trade practices act 1974 cth which pan has pleaded the judicial power of the commonwealth is exercised in resolving such matters here the controversy involves claims under two acts of the parliament each of which specifically and independently one of the other confers jurisdiction on this court accordingly i am of opinion that this court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this that is not to say however that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available necessarily to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person such as one under the trade practices act 1974 cth which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12 i am of opinion that the admiralty act 1988 cth cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction rather appositely to the present proceedings there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which comandate marine provided as security in lieu of the ship comandate to satisfy a claim made by pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the act pans claim in personam for relief under the trade practices act 1974 cth is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim s 51 of the federal court of australia act 1976 cth the court at the final hearing can address any injustice which might arise if comandate marine wishes then to agitate such matters including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the trade practices act 1974 cth the trade practices act 1974 cth provides pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims indeed

maritime carriers inc no 5 1998 90 fcr 1 in that case the relevant clause provided that any dispute arising from this charter would be settled in a london arbitration obviously it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made emmett j who delivered the leading judgment with whom branson j expressly agreed considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause cl 45b viz arising out of emmett j said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the trade practices act 1974 cth during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement 90 fcr at 21g but he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question 90 fcr at 22ab and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party 90 fcr at 22bc in francis travel marketing pty limited v virgin atlantic airways ltd 1996 39 nswlr 160 gleeson cj meagher and sheller jja agreeing held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s 52 of the trade practices act 1974 cth which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the precontractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s 52 of the trade practices act 1974 cth does not bring a statutory claim within the expression arising out of this contract gleeson cj had distinguished the reasoning of beaumont j in allergan pharmaceuticals inc v bausch amp lomb inc 1985 7 atpr ss40 636 on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement in the case before the court of appeal of new south wales the alleged contravention of the act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention 39 nswlr at 166fg as brennan and dawson jj noted in tanning research laboratories inc v obrien 1990 hca 8 1990 169 clr 332 at 344 with whom toohey j agreed at p 354 in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes arising out of or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof 169 clr at 337 the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between the parties or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause allergan pharmaceuticals inc v bausch amp lomb inc 1985 7 atpr ss40636 at 47173 in union of india v eb abbys rederi as the evje 1975 ac 797 lord morris of borthygest reasoned that a dispute was one arising out of a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the yorkantwerp rules 1950 and to be settled in london he said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation 1975 ac 807h808b 808g lord reid at 804e and lord simon of glaisdale agreed at 816c lord salmon reasoned to similar effect 1975 ac at 816f8 in ethiopian oil seed amp pulses export corporation v rio del mar foods inc 1990 1 lloyds rep 86 at 97 hirst j took the view that the words arising out of covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all he held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings and in incitec ltd v alkimos shipping corporation 2004 fca 698 2004 138 fcr 496 at 503504 32 37 allsop j held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses where the fair reading of them is not confined was to give width flexibility and amplitude to them see 2004 fca 698 138 fcr 496 at 504 36 allsop j agreed with what french j had said about the construction issue in paper products pty ltd v tomlinsons rochdale ltd 1993 43 fcr 439 there french j said of a clause providing for disputes arising under this agreement that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement can be said to arise out of the agreement they all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance no authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement 43 fcr at 448 in my opinion french js reasoning although directed to a different form of words is apposite here in respect of the trade practices act 1974 cth claims in the the playa laga 1983 2 lloyds rep 171 at 183 stephenson and ackner ljj and sir sebag shaw said that the words all disputes arising out of this contract are less precise than they looked they pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as lord sumner had said in produce brokers co ltd v olympia oil and cake co ltd 1916 1 ac 314 at 328 the english court of appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause their lordships obiter observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other the dispute falls within the arbitration clause 1983 2 lloyds rep at 183 and in allergan pharmaceuticals inc v bausch amp lomb inc 1985 7 atpr ss40 636 at 4717347174 beaumont j held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of pt v of the trade practices act 1974 cth the latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract he said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source and conduct for the purposes of pt v of that act would be established if at all irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties beaumont j said in short an alleged contravention of pt v of the trade practices act 1974 is not as a matter of characterization a controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the agreement for the purposes of that contract i agree with beaumont js analysis however in walter rau neusser oel und fett ag v cross pacific trading ltd 2005 fca 1102 at 56 allsop j suggested that the phrase arising out of in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical rather than theoretical meaning to be given to the word contract out of which disputes may arise he said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation extent and scope allsop j recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the full court in the kuikang career 1998 90 fcr 1 see 2005 fca 1102 68 i am of opinion that the full courts construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event like allsop j i am bound by it comandate marine argued that the decision of the majority of the high court in coventry v charter pacific corporation ltd 2005 hca 67 2005 222 alr 202 indicated that the kiukiang career 90 fcr 1 was no longer good law and it should not be followed i do not accept that argument the construction of the operation of ss 82 and 86 of the bankruptcy act 1966 cth with which coventry v charter pacific corporation ltd 2005 hca 67 2005 222 alr 202 was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression arising by reason of a contract thus gleeson cj gummow hayne and callinan jj held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were for the purposes of the bankruptcy act 1966 cth claims arising by reason of a contract 222 alr at 219 71 the claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose by reason of the contract because if the thing complained of namely the entry into the contract had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s 822 of the bankruptcy act 1966 cth here the claim under the trade practices act 1974 cth however did not arise out of the contract because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that act existed before the contract came into existence although elements of the performance of the contract or non performance of the contract will have become relevant next comandate marine argued that a grant of the antiantisuit injunction to enable pan to litigate its claims under the trade practices act 1974 cth amounted to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract the exercise by the court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the parliament is simply an instance of the court enforcing the law if comandate marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the trade practices act 1974 cth it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the court to grant remedies to pan flowing from that contravention estoppel comandate marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of art ii r 2 of the new york convention i do not understand how that could be the facts are objective the evidence of mr athanassiou and capt piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later cf masters v cameron 1954 hca 72 1954 91 clr 353 at 360 no conduct of pan induced some other state of mind there was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in pan taking the stance it did about the matter i see no substance in the argument antiantisuit injunction comandate marine argued that i should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate i am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the courts jurisdiction to give relief under the trade practices act 1974 cth is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the parliament of the commonwealth of australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country i remain of the opinion i expressed in my earlier judgment pan australia shipping pty ltd v the ship comandate 2006 fca 881 however comandate marine by its counsel offered an undertaking to the court that if it were found that s 72 of the international arbitration act 1974 cth did not require a stay of the trade practices act 1974 cth claims to consent to the london arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that act would apply as a matter of australian law relating to formation andor entry into of the charter andor relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl 45b and as part of the existing dispute referred to the london arbitration comandate marine by its counsel also proffered an undertaking to the court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties pan does not want london arbitrators to determine its claim under the trade practices act 1974 cth comandates undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators there is no power in s 72 to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the trade practices act 1974 cth that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate the court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause tanning research laboratories inc v obrien 1990 hca 8 1990 169 clr 332 at 344 while it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party given that there is now no dispute that comandate marine would seek to obtain against pan an injunction from the high court of justice in england restraining its prosecution of these proceedings if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in london it seems to me that for the reasons that i gave on 22 june 2006 the injunction must be continued balance of convenience re witnesses capt piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in greece or elsewhere than in australia the master and crew when not at sea might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere the vessels classification society representatives were in greece singapore and sri lanka the vessel had dry docked in sri lanka in december 2005 and there were also the ships agent and surveyor located there the owners and charterers singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in melbourne in june 2006 capt piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to london it is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the australian maritime safety authority officers and others in the australian ports as to the condition of the comandate at various times together with australian surveyors it will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in singapore and sri lanka as to the dry docking in sri lanka in 2005 the delivery and later repairs in singapore this year there may be some need for persons to come from greece although i think that capt piperakis evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute i do not think that that assumption is any longer correct although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by pan in the interlocutory hearing on 22 june 2006 while the master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessels condition it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing the critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by australian witnesses and members of the ships company pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least 12 different witnesses 10 from the authority who may be required to give evidence of course certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression i have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from sri lanka and singapore on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ships company will be from australia there does not appear to be any relevant connection to london other than the requirement in cl 45b that the seat of the arbitration be there conclusion i order that comandate marines

24792,82,31,229,80,10601,the applicant relies upon a line of cases in bankruptcy commencing with in re dagnall ex parte soan amp morley 1896 2 qb 407 pursuant to the married womens property act 1982 every married woman carrying on a trade separately from her husband shall in respect of her separate property be subject to the bankruptcy laws in the same way as if she were a feme sole mrs dagnall had been carrying on a trade separately from her husband having sold her business she gave notice to creditors that she was about to suspend payment of their debts as a result a bankruptcy petition was presented the question was whether or not the bankruptcy laws continued to apply to her after she had ceased trading but whilst she still owed trading debts the divisional court vaughan williams j and wright j found that the bankruptcy legislation continued to apply vaughan williams j said at 41011 but whether a person is carrying on a trade or not is a question of fact and if it were not for the decision in ex parte mcgeorge i would have said without any hesitation that as long as a woman trading separately from her husband had not paid the trade debts which she had incurred so long she was continuing to trade it seems to me that trading is not completed until you have performed all the obligations that the fact of trading imposed upon you and that was the view that was taken in the older cases then we have to consider whether there is anything in the decision in ex parte mcgeorge which prevents us from holding that the nonpayment of debts incurred by a married woman while trading separately is evidence that she is still continuing to trade 24 his lordship then referred to numerous older cases noting that the decision in ex parte mcgeorge had departed from them on the basis of differences in the wording of the relevant bankruptcy legislation two alternative lines of reasoning emerge from his lordships brief judgment the first is that a trader continues to trade until he or she has performed all obligations incurred as a result of such trading the second is that nonpayment of trading debts is evidence of continued trading presumably to be considered in the light of other evidence wright j disposed of the matter on a different basis holding at 411 that this appeal must be allowed upon the short ground that in my view the natural meaning of the section is that a married woman who trades separately is to be subject to the bankruptcy laws in respect of all debts incurred by her in the period during which she was carrying on the trade 26 those older cases are of some assistance in understanding the decision in dagnall in meggot v mills 1 ld raym 286 91 er 1088 it was said that though a man quits his trade yet he may be a bankrupt for the debts that he owed before 29 in bankruptcy matters dagnall has been followed in theophile v the solicitorgeneral 1950 ac 186 at 201203 in re bird v inland revenue commissioner 1962 1 wlr 686 at 695697 and in re a debtor 1992 ch 554 however in avondale motors parts pty ltd v commissioner of taxation 1971 hca 17 1971 124 clr 97 at 102103 gibbs j as his honour then was doubted the applicability of the decision in dagnall beyond the field of bankruptcy and into that of taxation law referring to the decision of tryka ltd v newall 1963 41 tc 146 where wilberforce j as his lordship then was said i do not think i can accept the application of the bankruptcy cases here it seems to me that the two fields are quite different when one is considering the question whether for purposes of bankruptcy laws a person is carrying on business it may be necessary to hold that he does not cease to carry on business when trading activity has ceased and for that reason the courts have been ready to extend the section so as to cover a case where he has left debts unpaid but to apply the same line of thought to income tax cases would lead to very great difficulties and indeed would mean that almost every case which one finds in the books on such questions as cessation of business would have been complicated by the introduction of this question and might indeed have been otherwise decided 38 one might well say that the railway company was in a position similar to that of the applicant prior to 25 june 2001 it had an interest in an asset which was being managed by another party and derived income from such interest however the change in the undertaking of the railway company effected by the 1906 agreement was quite different from that made to the applicants position by the agreement of 25 june 2001 the railway companys capital continued to be tied up in the railway and it continued to derive income from that source in the present case the applicant terminated its investment in the joint venture and ceased to derive income from it although lord sumners reference to dagnall may suggest some support for the applicants case the reference hardly amounted to an endorsement of the decision and his lordship clearly decided the case on its own facts the other law lords made no reference to dagnall the applicant also refers to decisions applying the dagnalltheophile line of authorities in the australian taxation board of review and in canada where bowman cj said it is i believe settled law that a business continues to be carried on so long as the obligations arising out of the business remain unfulfilled 39 the cases cited in dagnall and the reasons of wright j do not support that proposition even in the bankruptcy context the rule is rather that under bankruptcy legislation then in force trading debts were recoverable in bankruptcy after trading had ceased in australia two eminent judges have doubted the wisdom of applying that proposition in the tax context and a third brennan j appears to have had a similar view in england another eminent judge has expressed similar reservations the decision in south behar railway cannot be interpreted as an endorsement of the wider application of the decision in dagnall only one member of the house of lords referred to it and in a qualified way decisions in the australian taxation board of review can hardly be set against the views of the judges to whom i have referred the observation in the canadian case is not persuasive in the circumstances i decline to follow dagnall for present purposes

413414 his honour made the threshold observation that the doctrine of privity in interest operates in the same way upon the doctrines of cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel the basic requirement of a privy in interest being that the privy must claim under or through the person to whom he is said to be a privy the necessary identity in interest may arise from a successive relationship in a temporal sense when finding the necessary privity in a succussive or mutual relationship the courts have looked to legal rather than economic indicia as the criterion of operation of the privity doctrine one example to which his honour referred at 414 was of holders of successive interests in the same fund notwithstanding that they had become members of the fund subsequent to dismissal of proceedings brought by other beneficiaries his honour found that the applicant for relief in effem was not claiming under or in virtue of any legal right of the other applicants in the present proceedings the taxpayer applicants contended that there was an absence of satisfaction in the circumstances of this case of the requirement of privity of interest in relation to the respective claims of ief and qth on the one hand and that of spassked on the other implicitly notwithstanding that each was a wholly owned subsidiary of iel and moreover traced their ultimate corporate membership to the adsteam group in any event the taxpayer applicants contended in written submissions in reply as not disputed that if spassked and iel are not estopped from pursuing appeals

waltons at 413 and verwayen at 415 5 it may be possible to divide detriment into the narrower and broader sense although this approach which was stated by mason cj in verwayen at 415 really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment the narrower sense is reliance on the assumption whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption it is avoidance of the broader or real detriment flowing from reliance from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position grundt at 674 per dixon j verwayen at 415 per mason

wilson j and 459 per gaudron j and verwayen at 499 500 per mchugh j 14 the necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of brennan j in waltons at 428 429 in my opinion to establish an equitable estoppel it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that 1 the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and in the latter case that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship 2 the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation 3 the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation 4 the defendant knew or intended him to do so 5 the plaintiffs action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled and 6 the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise 15 in order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the others freedom to withdraw has gone that is to say there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed this is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by brennan j above and in the decision of the privy council in attorneygeneral hong kong v humphreys estate queens gardens limited

an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by lord kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in ramsden v dyson at 170 if a man under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land or what amounts to the same thing under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord and upon the faith of such promise or expectation with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him lays out money upon the land a court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation 21 lord kingsdowns statement of principle was approved by the privy council in plimmer v mayor of wellington 1884 9 ac 699

departure by one person that is to say qr from an assumption adopted by another ie nrc as the basis for nrcs decision to make the investment decisions to which i have referred see thompson at 547 673 thus although as i have said at 62 messrs butcher moorewilton and stanko and mrs yeoh gave evidence in general terms that they relied on mr graham it seems to me to be necessary to look at the evidence of their deliberations to see whether this was consistent with the approach taken by mr graham i do not consider that reliance in general terms can be sufficient in circumstances where the individual directors gave evidence of their own approaches to the matter 693 it follows that of the four pleaded assumptions only the second assumption finds any support in the evidence but the only evidence to support it was that of mr graham and his approach was inconsistent with that of the other directors in my opinion this does not establish that nrc adopted the assumption as the basis for the relevant actions within the principle stated by dixon j in thompson 744 as dixon j said in thompson at 547 whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption 745 even if the assumptions propounded by pn are capable in their terms of giving rise to an estoppel the claim fails because qr did nothing to occasion or cause the adoption of the assumption 746 mr graham formed his assumptions based upon his reading of the ea he did not put forward any positive statement or conduct by mr orourke or to the extent that mr hamills conduct is or may be relevant any positive statement or conduct of mr hamill instead he emphasised that nothing said by either of those persons in the period from 1992 to march 1997 was inconsistent with mr grahams understanding of the ea 865 the claim of lost opportunity to apply political pressure is to borrow from the words of starke j in thompson at 528 at best wholly speculative and conjectural and affords no solid basis for concluding that nrc acted to its detriment 866 the same may be said of the suggestion that nrc lost the opportunity to avail itself of the alternative dispute resolution provisions of cl 7 of the ea not only did nrc fail to invoke the clause but as i have already said the clause did not provide a mechanism for determination of the form or the terms of the rights to be accorded to nrc 867 there were three species of operational detriment identified by pn the first was generalised evidence of the adverse effect on future operating conditions at the ar terminal given in particular by mr fullerton the second was said to be the comparison between pns existing cost of operations and the price to be charged by qr under the terminal services agreement this proposition was put to qrs ceo mr scheuber in crossexamination
24613,3,5,169,64,22207,after considering the proposed orders the history of this matter and the submissions of counsel i am satisfied that the orders proposed by the parties in relation to the contempt charges are appropriate in the circumstances my reasons are as follows 1 i accept the applicants submissions in relation to withdrawing the charges against the first respondent i note that the first respondent is in liquidation and the submission in court on monday by mr aggs liquidator of the first respondent that the first respondent is insolvent i accept the proposition that in these circumstances pursuit of the first respondent which is a corporate entity is pointless there are no funds to satisfy any orders for example for a fine or costs it is therefore appropriate for the court to grant leave to the applicant to withdraw these charges 2 i accept the applicants submissions as to withdrawing the charges against the fifth respondent in light of his age his role in the conduct the subject of the applicants claims and the concession by the applicant as to the evidence against him 3 i note that the second third and fourth respondent have pleaded guilty which is an issue to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentence nw foods 71 fcr at 293 i note also the submission of mr atkinson for the second third and fourth respondents that in pleading guilty the respondents have avoided the need for two trials each of which was estimated to be four to five weeks and have therefore relieved the resources of both the court and the applicant cf nw foods 71 fcr at 291 4 in this case the second third and fourth respondents have pleaded guilty to a statement of charge alleging deliberate and repeated instances of contempt of the orders of cooper j given the nature of the contempt a significant penalty is in order 5 the courts have generally accepted that a term of imprisonment is appropriate only in the most serious criminal contempt cases r v fletcher ex parte kisch 1935 hca 1 1935 52 clr 248 at 257 per evatt j gallagher v durack 1983 hca 2 1983 152 clr 238 in this case the proposal of the parties that the third and fourth respondents be sentenced to six months imprisonment albeit suspended is at the high end of the range of penalty for contempt particularly as it is common ground that the respondents had not previously been found by the court to have acted in contempt however the serious nature of the contempt charges in this case to which the second third and fourth respondents have pleaded guilty in my view warrants the prospect of a period of imprisonment 6 the federal court is empowered to impose a sentence of imprisonment for contempt of court to be suspended on conditions including as to length of time of the suspension hughes trading as crowded planet v australian competition amp consumer commission 2004 fcafc 319 at 56 in the case before me the proposal that the sentence of six months be suspended for two years is consistent with other decisions involving similarly serious contempts of court cf hughes 2004 fcafc 319 at 57 7 in my view however while the sentence is at the higher range it is not so high as to be oppressive nw foods 71 fcr at 293 cf australian securities and investments commission v matthews 2001 39 acsr 110 where the contemnor was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment suspended for two years and the court similarly found that the sentence was not so high as to be oppressive 8 i note the parties jointly propose that the period of imprisonment of the third and fourth respondents be suspended in this context however i note that the applicant in this case is the state regulator in the field of consumer protection it is appropriate to accord weight to the views of the regulator in particular as to the deterrent quality both for the respondents and for others who may be disposed to engage in conduct of a similar kind nw foods 71 fcr at 292 mobil oil 2004 fcafc

lieu of a fine construction forestry mining amp energy union v bhp steel ais pty ltd 2003 fcafc 13 per moore j at 812 in this case the proposed orders do not include a fine to be paid by the second third and fourth respondents however they do impose an obligation on these respondents to pay a not insignificant sum in costs to the applicant 10 i am satisfied that this is not a case where the nature of the proposed penalty is an insufficient deterrent by community standards so as to cause the court to decline to sanction the proposal i note the submissions by mr atkinson that the suspension of the six month sentence results in the third and fourth respondents being their own judge and jury for 24 months and that this is wellcalculated to ensure their good behaviour while this remains to be seen in practice the detailed and clear nature of the proposed orders the permanent restraints on the conduct of the respondents as articulated in the proposal the not inconsiderable length of time during which the sentence is suspended and the default period of imprisonment in the event of breach of the orders in my view means that the proposed penalty appropriate in this case

appeal pursuant to s 35 the court exercises its original jurisdiction and conducts a hearing de novo it is to determine on the merits the same question that was before the registrar namely whether or not the trade mark should be accepted and in doing so it is to apply the same legal criteria that the registrar is required to adopt under the act the registrars decision is not to be presumed correct but the court is entitled to have regard to the registrars opinion as that of a skilled and experienced person in the field of trade mark registrations woolworths 1999 fcafc 1020 93 fcr 365 at 33 french j presumption of registrability and standard of proof dealing firstly with the issue of onus it is now well understood that s 33 of the act had the effect of reversing the previous position on onus under the 1955 act whereas under that act an applicant had to satisfy the registrar that there were no grounds to object to registration the position now is that an application must be registered unless the registrar is satisfied that there is a ground for rejecting it see s 33 and reg 17a24 see also the discussion by french j in woolworths 1999 fcafc 1020 93 fcr 365 at 15 and 2024 an applicant is thus said to have the benefit of a presumption of registrability under the act in other words a mark will be presumed registrable unless the registrar is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a ground to reject it exists in kenman kandy 2002 fcafc 273 122 fcr 494 the full court considered an application for registration of a shape mark where the only ground of possible rejection was s 412 the applicant adduced no evidence of use of the mark and did not rely on either s 415 or 6 as a result the case turned on the sole question whether the mark was inherently adapted to distinguish the applicants goods under s 413 in discussing the nature of appeals against decisions of the registrar french j stated at 22 since the enactment of the 1995 act the onus is no longer on the applicant to establish registrability as it was under the 1955 act registrar of trade marks v woolworths ltd 1999 fcafc 1020 1999 93 fcr 365 at 372 3 the application must be accepted unless the court is satisfied that it has not been made in accordance with the act or that there are grounds for rejecting it if the matter is in doubt then the application should be accepted the possibility of refusal after a contested opposition with evidence and closer scrutiny remains open the acceptance stage is not the time for detailed adversarial examination of the application that might be involved in an opposition registrar of trade marks v woolworths at fcr 377 acceptance for registration involves an initial screening process albeit it requires the application of statutory criteria and evaluative judgments by the registrar and the registrars delegates emphasis added later in addressing whether the mark was inherently adapted to distinguish his honour said at 50 it is necessary to bear in mind that this trade mark is still at the registration stage it enjoys the benefit of the presumption of registrability mandated by s 33 to the extent that critical criteria upon which registration might be rejected are in doubt the application should be accepted closer adversarial scrutiny may occur in opposition registrar of trade marks v woolworths at fcr 377 there is a tension between the operation of the presumption and the text and structure of s 41 section 413 requires the registrar to take into account the extent to which a mark is inherently adapted to distinguish in deciding whether or not it is capable of distinguishing the applicants goods section 414 then directs the decisionmaker to subs 415 and subs 416 if they are still unable to decide the question section 415 will be applicable if there is a finding that the mark is to some extent inherently adapted but the registrar is unable to decide on that basis alone that the mark is capable of distinguishing accordingly where there remains some doubt after considering s 413 about a marks capability to distinguish rather than resolving that doubt in favour of an applicant by operation of a presumption the statute expressly directs the decisionmaker to consider the criteria in subs 415 or subs 416 whichever is applicable these observations have been followed in several first instance decisions albeit with varying degrees of caution see bennett j in torpedoes sportswear pty ltd v thorpedo enterprises pty ltd 2003 fca 901 2003 59 ipr 318 torpedoes at 1622 finn j in austereo 2004 fca 968 61 ipr 257

seek to justify in a substantive way the approach of the full court in lomas it sought to rely on the decision and those that have followed it but it acknowledged that other decisions run counter to it in my view there is nothing in the relevant provisions that supports the imposition of a higher standard even at the acceptance stage the presumption of registrability arises from s 33 of the act woolworths 1999 fcafc 1020 93 fcr 365 at 24 kenman kandy 2002 fcafc 273 122 fcr 494 at 50 section 33 does not speak of being clearly satisfied it mandates acceptance of an application unless the registrar is satisfied that there are grounds for rejecting it on this point i prefer the views expressed by gyles j and in particular his honours observations that an acceptance that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not import a higher threshold than the conventional balance of probabilities see pfizer 2006 fca 1663 2006 70 ipr 599 at 18 the presumption as it is gives effect to the general position under the act that an applicant is not required to establish an absence of grounds to refuse or object to registration it should also be noted that in both woolworths 1999 fcafc 1020 93 fcr 365 and kenman kandy 2002 fcafc 273 122 fcr 494 both acceptance stage cases there is no suggestion that any special higher standard was

89 clr 540 at 602 in relation to a claim in conversion baldly said according to wellestablished principle the right was incapable of assignment either at law or in equity lord roskill said in trendtex trading corporation v credit suisse 1982 ac 679 at 702c though in general choses in action were assignable yet causes of action which were essentially personal in their character such as claims for defamation or personal injury were incapable of assignment 30 one well established category where an assignment is valid recognised by the authorities cited in poulton 89 clr 540 at 602 is an assignment of property even though the property may be incapable of being recovered without litigation or as it was put by lord roskill in trendtex 1982 ac 679 at 703 where the cause of action is incidental to a right of property that has been acquired there is no reason why such a cause of action could not include tort in an appropriate case eg detinue or conversion however based upon the submissions in this case examples of the practical application of the principle are sparse re daley ex parte national australia bank ltd 1992 37 fcr 390 was cited but the decision turned on what was

the necessary property in that case cohen j referred to the decision of gault j in first city corporation ltd v downsview nominees ltd 1989 3 nzlr 710 where it was held at 757 that the assignment of a debenture by a parent company to a subsidiary included an assignment of causes of action in tort against a receiver of the company that issued the debenture and that the causes of action in tort were ancillary to the assignment of the debenture and so valid the effect of that decision is somewhat clouded by the subsequent appellate history of the case first city corporation ltd v downsview nominees ltd 1990 3 nzlr 265 downsview nominees ltd v first city corporation ltd 1993 ac 295 although the appeals did not turn upon the point in issue here 31 the decision of finkelstein j in ts amp b retail systems pty ltd v 3fold resources pty ltd no 3 2007 158 fcr 444 may be seen as an example of the category of connection with property there the assignment of a cause of action for breach of confidential information connected with or relating to rights of property that were assigned was upheld see particularly 158 fcr 444 at 79 81 however that decision and others since 1982 have been influenced by dicta of lord wilberforce and lord roskill in trendtex 1982 ac 679 indicating another basis for exception from the general rule whether the assignee has a genuine and substantial interest in the success of the litigation per lord wilberforce at 694d or has a genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim of another per lord roskill at 703d 33 finkelstein j took the wider view in ts amp b retail systems pty ltd 158 fcr 444 and suggested that the high court in campbells cash and carry pty ltd v fostif pty ltd 2006 hca 41 2006 229 clr 386 had approved the

the reasoning of gummow hayne and crennan jj at 68 82 and callinan and heydon jj at 258 261 supports the opinion of finkelstein j in my opinion the principle enunciated in trendtex 1982 ac 679 can be taken to be established for australia it needs to be borne in mind that the statement in poulton 89 clr 540 was not the centre of controversy in that case 34 did all saints have a genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of tosichs claim there is no direct evidence concerning the position of all saints prior to the transaction the inescapable inference from all the circumstances including the structure of the transaction is that all saints was under the control of the warne interests and that the transaction was to ensure that this proceeding continued notwithstanding a reluctance to pursue it on the part of tosich in particular it seems to be aimed at removing or minimising tosichs risk as to costs it may be inferred that the purpose was to provide a vehicle for the defendants to pursue their crossclaims with the benefit of a claim proved by a plaintiff that would remove the kind of problem exemplified by cgu insurance ltd v amp financial planning pty ltd 2007 hca 36 2007 237 alr 420 2007 81 aljr 1551 2007 62 acsr 609 indeed as much was made clear by counsel for the plaintiffs and for the defendants on various occasions i do not see anything objectionable about that purpose or about the structure of the transaction all saints could not profit from the arrangement it is not trafficking in causes of actions in any real sense facilitation of crossclaims to be determined on their merits is not objectionable as such however it seems to me that the dicta in trendtex 1982 ac 679 would have to be extended to include these circumstances within the permissible categories of assignment the assignee is not shown to have had any interest in the claim prior to or regardless of the assignment in view of the controversy surrounding the topic an extension of the categories is not the province of a single judge 35 what then of the connection with property austin j found that there were property interests created by the scheme the deed purports to assign those interests and causes of action including the present in one sense there is a clear connection the intention is to recover the loss of property invested however the claim in negligence is not to recover the property that existed at the time of the transaction it is to recover the loss by way of damages in my opinion that is not the kind of claim connected with property that is covered by the traditional exception to the rule against assignment of causes of action assuming as i do that the exception can include claims in tort where appropriate the assignment of the cause of action in tort is not effective 36 in the course of argument counsel for the plaintiffs referred to a claim for money had and received the third amended originating process claims inter alia orders in the nature of restitutionary orders for the refund to the plaintiffs of the moneys originally invested in the queen victoria project by the first plaintiff and interest the third amended statement of claim does not

a migration agent on a decision of the tribunal was considered by the full court of this court in the recent decision of minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v szfde 2006 fcafc 142 szfde applicants for a protection visa engaged a man who said he was a solicitor with a lot of experience in migration matters unbeknown to the applicants he had been struck off as a solicitor and deregistered as a migration agent he told the applicants that they should not accept an invitation to appear before the tribunal at an oral hearing because their application would be refused he told them that he was going to write to the minister on their behalf and he was concerned that if they appeared before the tribunal they might say something inconsistent with what he said in the letter he told them not to worry that he was doing what was best for them the magistrate found that the agent had acted dishonestly and fraudulently in other word s his advice was not only bad but also fraudulent a majority of the court allsop and graham jj said that the fraud in that case did not provide a basis for setting aside the decision of the tribunal the tribunal was not aware of the fraud and had complied with the act in terms of extending an invitation to the applicants ss 425 425a 30 allsop j said that the decision of the tribunal was not induced or affected by fraud at 136 allsop j made the point that in the circumstances of the case before him the fraud was linked to the complaint that there had been a failure of procedural fairness the complaint of a lack of procedural fairness could not succeed in light of ss 422b 425 and 426a of the act allsop j also said that it was not a case where it could be said that the statutory process was corrupted by fraud at 139 graham j also dismissed the challenge based on fraud saying that even if there was fraud it was of no relevance at 191 and 237 31 french j dissented his honour held that the fraud of the agent gave rise to a jurisdictional error on the part of the tribunal saying that the tribunal made its decision at 131 blamelessly but pursuant to a process which unknown to it was compromised by third party fraud 32 on the basis of the majority decision in szfde the appellants submission that the fraud of mr han assuming contrary to my earlier conclusion that he was fraudulent vitiates the decision must be rejected 33 the appellants alternative submission was that the agents conduct led to a breach of the rules of procedural fairness and that that gave rise to a jurisdictional error this submission raises two questions first absent the particular statutory context is there what might perhaps be called a general rule that there is a breach of the rules of procedural fairness if a party fails to attend a hearing due to the erroneous advice of his agent secondly if there is such a rule does the particular statutory context negate the rule or the granting of relief i realise that dividing the issue into two questions is somewhat artificial but i think it does assist in the overall analysis 34 there are many cases in which the courts have considered whether in the absence of fault on the part of the decisionmaker there can be a breach of the rules of procedural fairness a number are discussed in the reasons for judgment of french j in szfd e see also aronson dyer and groves judicial review of administration action 3 rd ed 2004 pages 460463 they can perhaps be placed in various categories depending on one or more of the powers the court was exercising the status of the person at fault ie partys agent other party to the proceeding or a third party the nature of the conduct of the party at fault ie fraudulent or negligent and the effect of the procedural departure it seems fairly clear

the applicant for relief that was the view of the house of lords in almehdawi supra and of french j at 101103 and allsop j at 138 in szfde the appellants alternative submission fails on this ground 35 the submission would fail in any event because even if there was such a general rule it could not operate in the context of the provisions of the act section 422b provides that division 4 of part 7 is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with section 425 requires that the tribunal must invite an applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review that invitation was given in this case section 426a provides that where

19385,33,19,286,255,10227,in order to deal with these submissions i must consider the meaning of the term the owner in s 17 of the admiralty act the meaning of the term owner was considered for the purposes of s 19 by the full court in kent v ss maria luisa no 2 2003 fcafc 93 2003 130 fcr 12 and for the purposes of s 17 in tisand v mv cape moreton 2005 fcafc 68 2005 143 fcr 43 concerning that question the majority tamberlin and hely jj said in the maria luisa at 6166 61 the word owner cannot be given any general description but ordinarily the incidents of ownership of a chattel include the right to make physical use of the chattel the right to the income from it the power of management and the right of alienation in the iron shortland sheppard j quoted from the decision of the singapore court of appeal that the term owner means any person who is vested with such ownership as to have the right to sell dispose of or alienate the ship and that a beneficial owner of the ship comes within that term 62 the notion of ownership carries a connotation of dominance ultimate control and of ultimate title against the whole world 65 a helpful description of ownership is formulated by jordan cj in gatwood v alley where his honour said in relation to a question as to ownership of a car a good title to property in the sense of such ownership as the law allows consists in having the legal right to exercise with respect to it all such rights as against all such persons as by law are capable of being exercised with respect to property of the class in question a person who has possession of property but not ownership has as a general rule the same legal rights as the owner save to the extent to which those rights are qualified as against the owner 66 ownership whether legal or equitable therefore involves something greater than beneficial interest equitable ownership of property is commensurate with the right to relief in a court of equity if a person has contractual rights in relation to a ship which if performed will result in the person becoming the owner of the ship then the person will be regarded as the equitable owner of the ship provided that specific performance of the contract would be decreed 39 their honours then referred to the decision in the maria luisa and at 97 continued the full court decided the maria luisa in the context of the earlier decision of sheppard j in the iron shortland that the word owner was not restricted to registered owner but extended to include the true or real or beneficial owner it was not necessary for the full court to decide the question before us that is whether the phrase the owner necessarily included the registered owner 40 after referring to various authorities their honours observed at 119120 119 as is clear notions of property and ownership are not amenable to crisp comprehensive definition in the abstract the context here is the possession and enjoyment of dominion over and power or right to dispose of a chattel of a kind that is usually engaged in commercial enterprise in that context the word ownership or owner connotes the right or power to have and dispose of dominion possession and enjoyment of the ship subject of course to intervening interests 120 this kind of dominion exemplified or epitomised by the lawful power or right to dispose of the ship may arise from the legal effect of dealing between the parties with a ship under general law or statute 41 the court considered the legal consequences of registration discussing the purposes thereof which include the protection of the title of the registered owner and the protection and preservation of priorities between security interests in the ship the court then turned to the question of choice of law at 140 the court concluded that the proper law for the purpose of determining questions of jurisdiction was the law of the forum australia including its rules of private international law their honours considered that in connection with questions concerning transfer of title to a chattel those rules would normally lead to application of the lex situs of the chattel however the court identified difficulties in determining the situs of a merchant ship at 146147 their honours said 146 there seem to us to be powerful reasons for giving effect to the law of the country of register as the lex situs in relation to questions of title property and assignment subject of course to local statute and public policy the chance location of a working merchant ship in a port within its range of sailing or on the high seas appears to introduce an element of arbitrariness to the legal analysis this is especially so if as is likely the national register and registration laws of the port in question are directed to ships of that country if a law of a country other than the country of registration is chosen to deal with the assignment of property in a ship it is likely that there will be no statute dealing with registration that is made relevant 147 the relevant choices appear to be the law of the forum the law of the country of registry as the lex situs and not merely when the ship is on the high seas the law of the place of the ship within another countrys territorial waters and on one reading of certain decisions the law of the domicile of the registered owner or operator 42 in any event in the absence of any evidence as to foreign law their honours concluded that the question of choice of law was academic the court acted upon the presumption that the relevant foreign law was the same as the law of the forum australia without necessarily conceding the correctness of the approach their honours accepted that the lex situs ie the law of the registration state should be presumed to contain a statute in a form mutatis mutandis the same as the shipping registration act 1981 cth section 45 of that act provided the owner of the ship or of a share in a ship has power subject to this act and to any rights and powers appearing in the register to be vested in any other person absolutely to dispose of the ship or share and to give effectual receipts in respect of the disposal 43 at 161 the honours continued a power of that kind may well in many circumstances suffice to support the conclusion that the holder of such power was the owner it is a power which is the equivalent of the epitome of ownership a party who has power absolutely to dispose of a chattel has the equivalent of the ultimate incident of ownership the power derives from statute it is not a right arising from a consensual transaction but it is a power having equivalent effect 44 at 163 their honours observed it is necessary however to assess the importance of this power by reference to the surrounding factual circumstances 45 relevantly the registered owner had in fact sold the ship and received the sale price the court continued at 165168 165 under australian law and we would venture to suggest the law of any other country subject to any statute affecting the position the buyer took full property in the ship 166 on the assumption that the shipping registration act applies the owner had a power given by statute absolutely to dispose of the ship in the circumstances that obtained however the owner could not on any view exercise that power lawfully or honestly without the consent of the buyer it had transferred the ship relinquished its rights in her and been paid in full for her no circumstance could be shown for the honest or lawful exercise of the statutory power without the consent of the buyer 167 in these circumstances the holding of the statutory power of absolute disposition was empty of real and practical meaning or significance so to conclude is not to change the content of the power but to direct attention to the relevant question to be answered was a party who had entered and completed this transaction and who held a statutory power the primary purpose of which was the protection of the next registered owner conformably with honest dealing who had taken the property according to the transaction just completed in circumstances where there could be no occasion for the honest and lawful use of a power the owner of the ship 168 in our view the answer to that question is no the owner had no rights of dominion enjoyment or control over the ship arising from its dealing with the buyer or from its relationship with the ship it had by the law of the flag on the hypothesis of the relevance of the shipping registration act by the presumption a power to dispose of the ship but that power was incapable of lawful or honest exercise without the consent of the buyer so understood the power does not amount to a right of ownership 46 the plaintiff submits that i should accept registration of the ship in qatar as proof of ownership exhibited to the affidavit of mr hockaday filed on 17 september 2008 are resolution no 18 of 1980g and law no 19 of 1980g both apparently promulgated by the amir the first concerns registration of ships and safety conditions in qatar the second concerns registration and safety pertaining to small ships in that country i understand it to be accepted that these documents contain the relevant aspects of the law of qatar concerning the registration of ships resolution no 18 provides that a ship the total tonnage of which is 200 ton or more may not sail under the flag of qatar unless it is registered according to that resolution vessels under 200 ton may be registered under resolution no 18 but such registration is not mandatory law no 19 provides for an alternative system of registration for vessels under 200 ton it is not immediately clear whether the ship was registered under resolution no 18 or law no 19 however the application for registration indicates that its grt presumably gross registered tonnage is 200 ton whilst its net registered tonnage is 60 ton it is not clear whether it is the gross or net tonnage which applies for the purposes of regulation no 18 nor is it clear whether the various references to tonnage in the evidence in resolution no 18 and in law no 19 are to metric tonnes or imperial tons law no 19 establishes a register called the small ships register there is no indication on the certificate of registration or on the application for registration that the ship was or was to be on any such register it seems more probable than not that it was registered under resolution no 18 article 7 of that resolution provides for registration of ownership details article 8 requires that the ship owner supplier or captain notify the registration office of any amendment made to the registered details article 13 provides every legal act or incident or a judgment resulting in transferring or amending or forfeiting an inkind right on a registered ship shall not be in force between the concerned people or for the third party unless its registration is made in the ships register the concerned parties have right to apply for registration if any one of them refrains the matter may be presented to the court for ordering it 47 article 14 provides the registration order shall be as per the date of entry in the journal if many applications are presented related to one ship in one day the priority among them shall be as per the time of depositing the registration application and if many applications are presented together in one hour all of them shall be deemed in one order 49 the plaintiff also submits that the amirs entitlements under the agreement coupled with the substantial partpayments were sufficient to create an equitable interest equivalent to ownership for the purposes of s 17 however such equitable andor contractual rights were obviously subject to the limitation imposed by cl 16 of the agreement it cannot be said that at the relevant time the amir had either the right to possession of the ship or the right to dispose of it other than subject to the rights of sovereign it was not simply a question of paying the outstanding balance of the purchase price mr royets evidence demonstrates that prior to 21 july 2008 the ship had not been completed to the satisfaction of the amir or his agent until such time as the amir elected to accept the vessel in substantial satisfaction of sovereigns obligations under the agreement he could not have insisted upon physical delivery this is relevant to the point made by tamberlin and hely jj in the maria luisa at 74 prior to 21 july 2008 the amir had not exercised his right to accept the vessel pursuant to the contract he was in a position which might well have led to ownership but did not satisfy the requirements of in this case s 17 50 finally the plaintiff submits that the agreement was amended so that property passed at some earlier time and prior to 9 or 11 june 2008 the evidence of this amendment is said to be sovereigns provision of the builders certificate the apparent delay in completion and amiri yachts entitlement under the agreement to take possession of the ship in the event of default by sovereign cl 13 and to insure cl 15 against this is mr lloyds assertion that prior to 21 july 2008 sovereign remained in possession and full control of the ship it is true that in para 7 of his affidavit he did not refer to title he had done so in cl 6 but the relevant passage was objected to and excluded largely because it went to the proper construction of the agreement the evidence of both mr lloyd and mr royet suggests that the parties were until 21 july 2008 conducting themselves upon the basis that the ship was still under sovereigns legal and physical control in those circumstances i decline to infer that there had been any variation to the provisions of the agreement concerning the passing of property

that to the extent the respondents relied upon the concept of vulnerability this was misconceived because there was here a potential indeterminate liability and an ability by the investors including the applicant to protect themselves further it was contended that the concept of vulnerability may not be used to circumvent the historical preconditions to a claim for negligent misstatement against auditors as set forth in such cases as esanda 1997 hca 8 188 clr 241 when these preconditions establish the minimum threshold of vulnerability in factual situations in which they apply 55 in considering these contentions it is important to appreciate the context in which i am considering the issue of whether a duty of care as alleged by the respondents arises my task is to determine on this aspect whether a duty of care may exist in the context of the principles i have identified previously in these reasons relevant to the application of o 15a r 6 56 in this context i have come to the conclusion that the facts and elements relied upon by the respondent may give rise to the alleged duty of care to avoid pure economic loss such facts and elements being salient features which may give rise to the alleged duty 57 on the basis of the material before me i have not come to the view that the alleged duty of care is illfounded or doomed to fail or that in adopting the test to be applied in considering an application under s 31a of the federal court act the potential cause of action could be dismissed or struck out i do not accept that esanda 1997 hca 8 188 clr 241 and the other cases referred to by kpmg lay down any preconditions to liability of auditors where we are not dealing with a claim for negligent misstatement and where the concept of vulnerability may become relevant and where all the salient features of the case need to be examined no one salient feature is decisive and all the facts and circumstances relied upon need to be considered it can be accepted that auditors do not owe a duty as alleged merely by virtue of their acting in the capacity as auditors however more is relied upon by the respondents namely the facts and elements referred to earlier 60 the concept of vulnerability is now an important requirement in providing a basis for a duty of care to avoid economic loss it cannot be said that the decision in esanda 1997 hca 8 188 clr 241 should not be considered in light of the concept of vulnerability both these propositions follow from the passage in woolcock street investments pty ltd v cdg pty ltd 2004 hca 16 2004 216 clr 515 at 23 footnotes omitted since caltex oil and most notably in perre v apand pty ltd the vulnerability of the plaintiff has emerged as an important requirement in cases where a duty of care to avoid economic loss has been held to have been owed vulnerability in this context is not to be understood as meaning only that the plaintiff was likely to suffer damage if reasonable care was not taken rather vulnerability is to be understood as a reference to the plaintiffs inability to protect itself from the consequences of a defendants want of reasonable care either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of loss on the defendant so in perre the plaintiffs could do nothing to protect themselves from the economic consequences to them of the defendants negligence in sowing a crop which caused the quarantining of the plaintiffs land in hill v van erp the intended beneficiary depended entirely upon the solicitor performing the clients retainer properly and the beneficiary could do nothing to ensure that this was done but in esanda finance corporation ltd v peat marwick hungerfords the financier could itself have made inquiries about the financial position of the company to which it was to lend money rather than depend upon the auditors certification of the accounts of the company 61 as was observed though in esanda 1997 hca 8 188 clr 241 the financier could itself have made inquiries about the financial position of the company to which it was to lend money this being relevant to vulnerability 62 in esanda 1997 hca 8 188 clr 241 the appellant was a sophisticated investor well able in the circumstances to protect itself it at least had a capacity to consider the investment whereas in this proceeding the complaint is that the vulnerability arises after the making of the investment where the investor arguably has no ability to look after itself the concept of the ability to protect oneself is always relative and will depend upon many factors and circumstances these are yet to be fully investigated in this proceeding 68 of course there are other policy considerations that may impact upon whether the court should deny the duty of care alleged here namely the impact of prolonged and multiple actions against auditors the availability of other civil and criminal proceedings against auditors and the public interest in ensuring there are auditors ready and willing to perform their duties at a reasonable cost these matters were raised in esanda 1997 hca 8 188 clr 241 at 282 to 289 per mchugh j they are matters which need to be considered but none in my view are of sufficient weight in the context of my inquiry to conclude that the facts and elements relied upon by the respondents could not give rise to a duty of care as alleged it is still not possible to identify precisely a line of demarcation between the cases of pure economic loss in which damages are recoverable and those in which they are not recoverable but i

1227,27,9,23,16,21706,the committee was required to prepare a draft report setting out its preliminary findings subs 106kd1 of the act it was submitted that the fact that those views were unfavourable to dr mathews is not of itself evidence of bias or prejudgment see minister for immigration amp multicultural amp indigenous affairs v sban 2002 fcafc 431 at 11 that is undoubtedly correct 32 the committee discussed dr mathews submissions on the draft report in the final report at 95 100 it declared at 96 that after careful consideration of the submissions it was not persuaded to change its finding that dr mathews engaged in inappropriate practice in relation to the referred services dr mathews characterises his submissions as careful detailed and reasoned and the amendments which the committee made in its final report as grudging and minor but it was submitted that the use of emphatic language without more is unhelpful it was further submitted that in essence dr mathews contention is that a finding of apprehended bias should be made merely because the committee did not accept the changes to the draft report which he proposed in my view there is substance in that submission 33 dr mathews selected four examples to demonstrate the alleged prejudgment these were summarised in the respondents written outline of submissions as follows a appendix 1 service no 4 at the committee hearing on 30 october 2003 the applicant told the committee that he referred the patient to an allergy specialist ordered an ige test thinks he performed a spirometry test and that the management plan for her was ventolin in the draft report the committee said inter alia that there was insufficient evidence of the development or implementation of an adequate management plan for the patients presenting problem the applicant said in his submission on the draft report i do not accept this reason i referred the patient to an allergy specialist ordered an ige pathology test and performed a spirometry test i had also been prescribing her ventolin in my submission that must fall within the range of what is an acceptable management plan in its final report the committee repeated the finding that it had made in the draft report b appendix 2 service no 1 at the committee hearing on 31 october 2003 the applicant told the committee that he did not remember the consultation at the committees request he read out his clinical note vomiting promethazine 4 ue urea electrolytes and creatinine which is in those days i think they were bundled in together with a liver function test in those days i think in its draft report the committee said inter alia that at this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 40 year old patient presenting with a migraine headache the applicant said in his submission on the draft report i did record a selective history of vomiting i knew from the visit the previous day that the patient was suffering from migraine there was a management plan recorded which was to give the patient an injection of promethazine and i advised her to undergo further tests to check her liver function kidney function and the state of her hydration in its final report the committee repeated the finding that it had made in the draft report c appendix 2 service 3 at the committee hearing on 31 october 2003 the applicant told the committee that he did not remember the consultation he read out his clinical note foc ceclor cd ventolin and becloforte in answer to a question about whether he performed a peakflow reading he said i did not perform a peak flow reading it is not written down i do not know whether i did sometimes yes i did but it is not written down there so i do not recall in its draft report the committee said inter alia that at this home visit there was no selective history or ongoing management plan recorded in response to this 15 year old patient who had a flare up in his chest no peak flow reading was performed on this young patient who had a history of asthma the applicant said in his submission on the draft report i did record a selective history with my shorthand notation foc the patients history of asthma and smoking was known to me i did record my management plan which was to prescribe ceclor for his chest infection ventolin and becloforte for the patients asthma the evidence does not indicate that a peak flow reading was not performed and in my submission the committee cannot make such a finding see t p 26 line 31 ff in its final report the committee repeated the finding that it had made in the draft report d appendix 3 service 15 at the committee hearing on 31 october 2003 the applicant told the committee that i gave him the ducene in an attempt to reduce his alcohol consumption and because of the anxiety associated with living with his partner christine who was an invalid so in a fashion he was a carer and as i said his legs he had been my patient for probably 15 years the applicant also told the committee that the presenting complaint with ron was that he was had massive anxiety because he was worried about christine and his knees there is a note before approximately 6 or 8 weeks before that his knees and his lumbar sacral spine because when christine fell over he would have to pick her up and as i said he has i have asked him to have his knees xrayed many many times he has never had it xrayed he is noncompliant in its draft report the committee said inter alia no evidence that this service was other than a simple problem requiring minimal input limited examination and management in dr mathews oral evidence he stated that he wrote a prescription for ducene for the pain to damaged knees the applicant said in his submission on the draft report that i do not agree with this view of the consultation at t p 49 line 32 i said that i gave ducene in an attempt to reduce the patients alcohol consumption not for pain my oral evidence indicates that this was not a straightforward consultation having regard to the underlying social problems within the patients household the patients knees have been a matter of ongoing concern for some time in its final report the committee repeated the finding that it had made in its draft report footnotes omitted 38 pursuant to subs 106k3 the minister made health insurance professional services review sampling methodology determination 2000 no 1 the sampling determination which provides inter alia part 1 preliminary 1 2 3 purpose this determination specifies the content and form of a sampling methodology that may be used by a committee in making findings for an adjudicative referral 4 application 1 this determination applies if the committee decides in respect of conduct in connection with rendering or initiating the services included in a particular class of the referred services to have regard only to a sample of the services included in the class 2 the sampling methodology in part 2 applies to a individual items and multiple item episodes in classes of services and b individual items and multiple item episodes in classes of patients 5 definitions in this determination act means the health insurance act 1973 class size in relation to a sample means the number of services rendered or initiated in the particular class of referred services from which a sample is chosen exploratory sample has the meaning given in section 8 final random sample has the meaning given in section 10 preliminary random sample has the meaning given in section 6 note 1 the following terms that are used in this determination are defined in subsection 3 1 of the act 8226 initiate 8226 patient part 2 sampling methodology 6 preliminary random sample in having regard under subsection 106k 1 of the act only to a sample of the services included in a particular class of referred services a committee must ensure that the sample the preliminary random sample is a random sample 7 appropriate sample size 1 the preliminary random sample must be of an appropriate sample size to enable prediction with 95 confidence that the percentage of services constituting inappropriate practice worked out from the sample is within 10 of the actual percentage of inappropriate services rendered or initiated in the class of referred services sampled at a hypothesised incidence of inappropriate practice of 50 of services rendered or initiated the incidence requiring the largest sample 2 for a class of services specified in a referral the appropriate sample size of the preliminary random sample is at least n 1001n1 where n class size 3 if the appropriate sample size worked out is not a whole number it must be rounded up to the next whole number 8 exploratory sample in making a finding based on statistical sampling the committee must a examine a sample preferably of 30 or more services but not less than 25 services the exploratory sample randomly drawn from the preliminary random sample and b determine whether or not each of those services constitutes inappropriate practice 9 percentage of inappropriate practice in exploratory sample 1 after the committee has determined which of the services in an exploratory sample constitute inappropriate practice it must work out the percentage of services in the sample that constitutes inappropriate practice 2 the percentage must be expressed as a whole number being if necessary rounded down to the nearest whole number 10 39 paragraphs a b and c of ground 8 as pleaded are not in issue paragraph d contains the first allegation of error dr mathews contends that the terms of s 6 of the sampling determination in particular the words must ensure when used in relation to the words that the sample the preliminary random sample is a random sample effectively requires the committee to undertake the sampling itself alternatively it is said that if s 6 does not require the committee to do the sampling itself it requires the committee to ensure for itself that a sample of the services included in a particular class of selected services is a random sample and that this cannot be satisfied where the committee merely relies on a list of services of a particular class derived from a larger list of services of that particular class fed to them by the director even if the committee has no reason to think that the larger list of services of that particular class is not a random sample 40 the primary submission can be rejected out of hand on no construction of s 6 of the sampling determination can it be said that it requires the sampling to be carried out by the committee itself

18596,73,5,41,21,17948,respondent said that given the power to administer an oath or affirmation s 524 the fact that the obligation to answer questions is subject to only limited excuses s 526 and s 53 and the right to legal representation s 523 a power in the abc commissioner to regulate and control an examination must be implied that conclusion was said the respondent supported by the decision of the full court of this court in australian securities commission v bell 1991 32 fcr 517 bell in bell an inspector was conducting an examination in the course of an investigation by the australian securities commission the commission and he made an order that an examinee not be represented by a particular legal practitioner the order was made on the basis that the legal practitioner had appeared for a number of examinees and the legal practitioners firm had been involved in the preparation of a prospectus which might be under consideration in the course of the investigation the australian securities commission act 1989 cth contained provisions to the effect that an examinee may have legal representation s 231 that an examination was to be in private s 221 that the inspector could determine who was to be present at the examination s 221 and provisions dealing with the inspectors powers to control the conduct of a legal representative at an examination s 232 the decisions in a b and d and bell were referred to with approval by the queensland court of appeal in re whiting 1994 1 qd r 561 a firm of solicitors was acting for a police officer who was the subject of a complaint under the criminal justice act 1989 qld and for three police officers who were witnesses in the proceeding the chairman of the criminal justice commission ruled that the same legal representative would not be authorised by the commission to represent both the potential witnesses and the officer against whom the complaint was made an application to the supreme court challenging the order was dismissed in stockbridge v ogilvie 1993 43 fcr 244 french j followed bell and in the course of his reasons said at 254 where one lawyer seeks to represent a number of examinees in the same investigation it may be thought that there is a risk that without consciously intending any impropriety that lawyer might divulge to one examinee what has passed in the examination of another the extension of a restriction to all members of a given firm may be controversial see wood v national companies amp securities commission 1990 2 war 176 however there are matters of judgment and assessment involved it is of course not the role of the asc to supervise the lawyerclient relationships of those who appear before it in s 19 examinations it is only where a conflict of interest has some actual or potential impact on the investigative process that a direction based on such a concern would be within power in gangemi v australian securities and investment commission 2003 fca 494 2003 129 fcr 284 french j considered whether the australian securities and investment commission the commission had the power to give a nondisclosure direction and to direct that solicitors who had acted for other persons the commission might wish to examine be excluded from the applicants examinations he followed bell and his own decision in stockbridge v ogilvie supra and held that the commission had both these powers the statutory provisions in this case are very general they may be contrasted with the quite detailed provisions under consideration in cases such as a b and d and bell nevertheless i think it is clear that the abc commissioner must have the power to regulate and control the conduct of proceedings before him he can determine when and where an examination will be held and providing a proper basis exists he can regulate and control how the examination is to proceed and who may be present he is charged with the function of conducting an investigation into suspected unlawful conduct and may bring proceedings for a civil penalty in relation to that conduct he must be taken to have by implication the power to make orders or give directions which will ensure the integrity of the investigation and to a point its effectiveness in my opinion he has the power to exclude a particular legal practitioner from acting or appearing for an examinee at an examination it is appropriate for me to consider whether insofar as the direction is within power there was a proper basis to exercise the power the test as formulated in a b and d is whether the decisionmaker concludes on reasonable grounds and in good faith that to allow the representation either will or may prejudice the investigation which it is obliged to carry out pursuant to the terms of its statute at 448 in bell lockhart j said that he favoured a test which presented a slightly higher barrier of will or is likely to prejudice the investigation although he went on to say that the difference in practical application will depend on judicial approach to the facts of the particular case at 522 in my respectful opinion although there is something to be said for a test which presents a slightly higher barrier the weight of authority is in favour of the test of will or may prejudice the investigation and it is that test which i will apply

7139,33,9,33,11,15860,i find the evidence of the applicants boyfriend to be of no assistance to me in determining whether the applicant was fit enough to attend court on the morning of 12 october 2007 given the lack of time he appears to have spent with the applicant around the time when the hearing was due to take place and the fact that his evidence really only repeats what the applicant said to him rather than expresses his own observations on the applicants alleged condition at the times when he did see her consequently i find that the applicant has not demonstrated a satisfactory explanation for her failure to attend the hearing which was listed on 12 october 2007 15 applications for leave to appeal may be heard either by a full court or by a single judge s 252a federal court of australia act 1976 cth the principles relevant to a grant of leave are not in doubt the root authority being deacutecor corp v dart industries inc 1991 3 fcr 397 those principles are firstly whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being considered by the full court and secondly whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong later in time and in the context of an application for leave to appeal from a decision of the federal magistrates court dismissing an application for the judicial review of a decision of the tribunal hely j remarked in naca v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs 2003 fca 659 at 12 that an applicant had to show an arguable case that the rrts decision should be quashed on the grounds of jurisdictional error 16 whether a judgment is interlocutory rather than final and hence requires a grant of leave to appeal by virtue of s 241a of the federal court of australia act is sometimes a question of considerable nicety it is the legal effect of a judgment rather than its practical effect that is determinative of the question whether a judgment is final or interlocutory
21437,27,2,369,241,23433,however the tribunal accepted the commissioners submission that where joint holders had made unequal contributions to the acquisition of an asset there being no presumption of advancement a resulting trust is presumed for them as tenants in common in proportion to the values of their respective contributions to the consideration the tribunal referred to calverley v green 1984 hca 81 1984 155 clr 242 the tribunal said that while there was some evidence as to the value of claude cassegrains possible claim in defamation which he never commenced its value was by no means close to 425 million the tribunal accepted that the onus was on gcc and cfe to establish the value of claude cassegrains rights and that since they had not done so it was reasonable to attribute the entire consideration of 95 million to the rights given up by gcc pursuant to s 160zd4 of the act noted at 60 above 65 the tribunal noted that claude griffith had given evidence that gcc had claimed deductions for most of its expenses incurred in the joint venture and cassiros activities including concessional deductions for research and development under s 73b of the act and that claude cassegrains evidence was that an important objective of the settlement was to recover the amount that gcc had invested in cassiro the tribunal considered that it would be double counting to allow those costs to be included in the cost base of the asset rights given up by gcc at para 41 consequently the tribunal found that the cost base of gccs rights disposed of in the settlement by reason of s 160m3b which the tribunal observed effectively treated a release of gccs rights as a disposal of the rights was nil given that the acquisition costs were either not capital in nature or would be doublecounted 66 in the result the tribunal concluded that a capital gain of 95 million accrued to gcc under s 160z this being the excess of the disposal consideration over the cost base nil of the asset given up to acquire that sum 77 6 the applicants contend that the tribunals principal error of law was to ignore the terms of the deed and to rewrite it by reference to the principles of resulting trusts although i would not describe the finding of a resulting trust as a rewriting of the deed i agree with the applicants that the resulting trust principle recognised in the case of owners of land as joint tenants at law in calverley v green has no application the trust in question whether called properly called resulting or implied is presumed in the absence of evidence of an intention to the contrary in all the cases in which the principle has been applied of which i am aware the trust has arisen from the provision of purchase money in a way that does not correspond with the way in which legal title is taken perhaps the principle would also apply if although not in the form of money the consideration could be regarded as equivalent to money in the present case however the consideration provided for the payment of 8835083 and the csiro parties releases and contractual undertaking consisted of releases and contractual undertakings by gcc and claude cassegrain separately and jointly and severally 78 7 arguably a further reason why a calverley v green resulting trust did not come into being is that it would be inconsistent with the intention of at least one party to the deed that it should do so by making the apportionment agreement claude cassegrain showed an intention that was inconsistent with a presumption that he and gcc were to hold the sum of 95 million beneficially for themselves as tenants in common in equity in whatever proportions might turn out to reflect the values of their respective contributions to the consideration provided to the csiro parties 79 8 so far as i know no preexisting asset disposed of by the deed was owned by gcc and claude cassegrain as joint tenants each of them had its or his own separate potential claim against the csiro parties there were the claims already asserted by gcc alone in proceeding ng 3062 of 1992 with the further claims of conspiracy to cheat and defraud abuse of process and defamation and injurious falsehood to be introduced by way of the proposed second further amended statement of claim see 26 above there was also a possible claim of defamation of claude cassegrain that had been obliquely referred to in the cassegrain letter see 21 above it is noteworthy in passing and only by way of interest that in the cassegrain letter the amount claimed for defamation was 5 million which was approximately one eleventh of the total amount of 56033000 claimed in that letter the remaining 51033000 was clearly claimed by gcc alone the sum of 5 million was not claimed for the defamation of claude cassegrain alone it was claimed for defamation of gcampco cassegrain family name cassegrain group of companies and claude cassegrain and his family if the sum of 95 million were to be regarded as having been paid in conformity on a pro rata basis with the cassegrain letter some 850000 would be treated as having been paid in respect of the threatened defamation claim of which apparently claude cassegrain would be entitled to some unidentified part the other parts being in respect of defamation claims by gcc other unidentified cassegrain companies and other unidentified members of the cassegrain family there was of course no agreement that the settlement sum was related to the different elements identified in the cassegrain letter 80 9 there is no reason to distinguish between csiros paying 8835083 and the csiro parties releases and contractual undertakings as making up the consideration for the cassegrain parties releases and other contractual undertakings in other words if it were possible to apportion the value of the cassegrain parties releases and contractual undertakings as between gcc and claude cassegrain it would be appropriate to apply those proportions to the sum of 8835083 and if it should be relevant to the value of the csiro parties releases and contractual undertakings 90 the second fifth sixth seventh and ninth questions of law are second question of law did the tribunal err in law by not concluding that the deed of settlement entered into on 27 september 1993 between g cassegrain amp co pty limited claude cassegrain the csiro and sirotech limited the deed of settlement either alone or when considered with the simultaneous payment of 95m thereunder to or at the direction of g cassegrain amp co pty limited and claude cassegrain jointly was the only relevant transaction under which a capital gain accrued to g cassegrain amp co pty limited and claude cassegrain jointly for the purposes of part iiia fifth question of law did the tribunal err in law by declining to apply s 160zn1a to the capital gain which accrued to g cassegrain amp co pty limited and claude cassegrain jointly under the deed of settlement for the purposes of determining the amount of the capital gain which accrued to each of them under that transaction sixth question of law did the tribunal err in law when it went behind the deed of settlement in order to reconstruct the transaction which it consummated in reliance on the doctrine of resulting trusts and the principle of law enunciated in calverly v green 1984 hca 81 1985 155 clr 242 sic seventh question of law did the tribunal err in law by concluding that the applicants bore an onus to establish the value of the rights which they surrendered under the deed of settlement in favour of csiro and sirotech limited for the purposes of part iiia ninth question of law did the tribunal err in law when it concluded that a capital gain of 95m accrued to g cassegrain amp co pty limited pursuant to sections 160m3b and 160z in consequence of its entry into the deed of settlement and the simultaneous payment of 95m under it 91 the grounds stated in the notice of appeal that relate to the second question of law are directed against the tribunals finding of a constructive trust i agree that the circumstances did not give rise to a constructive trust for reasons that i gave earlier the case is not one of purchase money or perhaps its equivalent for the purchase of property 92 ground 4e suggests that the consequence of removing constructive trust from the picture is that we are left with the result that a capital gain accrued to gcc and claude cassegrain jointly and in consequence as tenants in common in equal shares despite the operation of the apportionment agreement as a side agreement

1347,36,37,473,13,33558,the applicant lodged notices of objection against the ato assessments and the penalty imposed as indicated earlier in this judgment on 27 september 2002 the respondent disallowed the applicants objections tribunal decision 5 in the tribunal the submissions of the applicant and the subsequent findings were as follows 1 the applicant contended that the activities of the applicant in relation to the land were in the nature of a profitmaking venture however the learned senior member was not persuaded by that characterisation of the applicants business activity reasons for decision para 34 and was of the view that the land was a capital asset with the result that the loss on its sale was a capital loss para 35 2 the applicant contended that company losses could be carried forward on the basis that the continuity of ownership test in s 80a itaa 1936 had been satisfied and during the relevant period the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant remained with mr paul doumany or that the same business test in s 80e itaa 1936 had been satisfied the senior member observed that given his findings concerning the characterisation of the applicants business activity and the resultant loss it was strictly unnecessary for him to reach a decision on either of these issues in any event however the senior member was satisfied that 8226 while the legal ownership of the shares in the applicant may have remained with mr doumany at the time the loss on the sale of the land was incurred the beneficial ownership of shares in the applicant rested in mr iwasaki having been transferred to mr iwasaki on or before 20 december 1991 accordingly the applicant failed on the continuity of ownership test in s 80a para 40 and 8226 there had been a significant break in the business activities of the applicant between november 1992 and 1996 and the applicant therefore failed on the same business test in s 80e para 45 3 the tribunal noted that the applicant bore the onus of proving the objection decisions should have been made differently s 14zzkb taxation administration act 1953 cth ta act para 27 although the senior member was not prepared to draw an adverse inference from the failure of mr doumany to give evidence in accordance with the rule in jones v dunkel 1959 hca 8 1959 101 clr 298 para 28 he noted that the failure of mr doumany to give evidence meant that it was more difficult for the applicant to show that the commissioners decision was wrong para 29 4 the applicant contended that a penalty of 75 was inappropriate because it acted with the advice of senior counsel however the senior member was satisfied that the penalty of 75 under s 226j itaa 1936 was appropriate para 50 questions of law raised on appeal 6 the questions of law raised on appeal in this case were as follows a are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under s 511 itaa 1936 b if yes to a in the relevant years of income i did s 80a itaa 1936 apply to deny the applicant deductions or ii did s 80e itaa 1936 apply to allow the applicant deductions c if the applicant was wrong in claiming deductions were penalties correctly imposed under s 226j itaa 1936 d did the tribunal err in instructing itself as to the applicants onus of proof and as to its role in reviewing the objection decision e did the tribunal err in not providing reasons for its rejection of the preponderance of the evidence as to the beneficial ownership of the shares f did the tribunal err in finding that the applicant was not carrying on the same business in the relevant years within s 80e g could a reasonable tribunal have made on the material before it the findings made h does the tribunals apparent error of fact namely that mr doumany was prosecuted in the criminal courts for causing the applicant to claim the deductions show that the tribunal failed to give due consideration to the material before it or give rise to a reasonable apprehension of wrongful bias against the applicant 7 i shall address each of these questions in turn a are the losses incurred by the applicant allowable as deductions under section 511 itaa 1936 8 as the relevant loss occurred in the 1993 year of income both applicant and respondent accepted that the relevant statutory provision was s 511 itaa 1936 9 the applicant submitted that 8226 the tribunal applied the wrong test of deductibility to the facts as found 8226 the tribunal did not refer to the relevant test of when a profit from sale of a capital asset as opposed to the proceeds of sale of a revenue asset was on revenue account which it submitted was whether the asset was acquired with a purpose or intention of profitmaking by sale this the applicant submitted was the relevant inquiry not whether the land was trading stock or whether the gross proceeds were on revenue account 8226 the tribunal failed to direct itself as to the proper test of whether land is acquired as part of a profitmaking undertaking being whether one of the purposes of its acquisition rather than the purpose was profitmaking by sale 8226 the test was not whether the applicant was in the business of property development with the land being trading stock moana sand pty ltd v federal commissioner of taxation 1988 88 atc 4897 in particular the applicant submitted that in moana sand 88 atc 4897 the profit made by the taxpayer was held to be income because one of the taypayers purposes was profitmaking by subdivision and sale even though the subdivision was not in fact carried out and the taxpayer had to sell the land en globo due to a compulsory acquisition the applicant also cited in support of its case federal commissioner of taxation v cooling 1990 22 fcr 42 and westfield ltd v federal commissioner of taxation 1991 28 fcr 333 10 in response the commissioner submitted that 8226 the necessary requirement of deductibility under s 511 is that the loss is incidental and relevant to the incomeearning operations of the taxpayer 8226 the ultimate question must remain whether the loss incurred had the necessary connection with the applicants gaining or producing assessable income or the carrying on of its business 8226 the question of whether the taxpayer carries on a business is a question of fact 8226 citing gibbs j in commissioner of taxation v williams 1972 hca 31 1972 127 clr 226 at 249 proceeds resulting from the mere realisation of a capital asset are not income even though the realisation is carried out in an enterprising way so as to secure the best price however a distinction needs to be drawn between mere realisation of an asset and development and improvement of land to such a marked degree that it is impossible to say that it is mere realisation of an asset as was the case in federal commissioner of taxation v whitfords beach pty ltd 1982 hca 8 1982 150 clr 355 8226 the test propounded by the applicant was referable to the former s 26a itaa 1936 and was of no application in this case the land in question was purchased subsequent to the introduction of the capital gains tax provisions in september 1985 and s 26a the more recent s 25a and s 52 have no application to the transaction 8226 profits brought to tax under statutory income provisions are not to be equated with net gains which may well fall within the ordinary concept of income 8226 in this case the tribunal found that the applicant did not acquire the land for the purpose of subdivision development and sale and the steps taken towards further development of the property were so limited that the whole undertaking could not be said to be comparable to the situation in whitfords beach 1982 hca 8 150 clr 355 reasons for decision para 32 section 511 itaa 1936 11 this section has been interpreted many times and at the highest judicial level in australia at the relevant time it read as follows all losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital or of a capital private or domestic nature or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income 12 in the context of the section it is clear that 8226 the expression incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income requires that the occasion of the loss or outgoing should be found in whatever is productive of the assessable income or if none be produced would be expected to produce assessable income ronpibon tin nl v federal commissioner of taxation 1949 hca 15 1949 78 clr 47 at 57 8226 the reference to losses and outgoings necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income adds little to the operation of the leading words losses or outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing assessable income ronpibon tin 78 clr at 56 8226 losses and outgoings of capital are clearly excluded from the operation of the section even if they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income or are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income 13 in the case before the senior member a key issue in dispute was whether the loss in this case should be characterised as capital or income if the loss was a capital loss it would not be an allowable deduction within the meaning of s 511 capital vs income 14 in a regulatory environment where taxation legislation is as extensive as it is complex the issue in question before the senior member was one of deceptive simplicity were the losses claimed by the applicant to be characterised as capital or revenueincome despite the plethora of cases over the years considering the distinction between income and capital to paraphrase wilson j in whitfords beach 150 clr at 393 the battle lines drawn by the parties in this case have a familiar ring the outcome of each case will invariably depend on the facts of that case before turning to the decision of senior member mccabe it is useful to summarise general legal principles relevant to this question definitions 15 despite extensive legislative intervention over the years to identify forms of income and capital for the purposes of commonwealth taxation legislation neither term is legislatively defined it is clear that because of the traditional characterisation of receipts and expenditure as either income or capital the term income has not extended to all forms of gain nor has loss in revenue terms included all forms of loss for an interesting discussion of this issue see the article by professor jeff waincymer if at first you dont succeed reconceptualising the income concept in the tax arena 1994 19 mulr 977 however as observed by jordan cj in scott v commissioner of taxation 1935 35 sr nsw 215 at 219 in relation to income the word income is not a term of art and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind except in so far as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts 16 a consequence of taxation reform has been that the traditional distinction between gains characterised as either income or capital has blurred over time with obvious examples being the introduction of concepts of statutory income in the itaa 1936 and income tax assessment act 1997 cth and the treatment of profits made in respect of disposal of assets acquired after 19 september 1985 following the introduction of the capital gains tax regime in australia however notwithstanding what has been termed the almost arbitrary nature of the distinction note for example comments of greene mr in inland revenue commissioners v british salmson aero engines ltd 1938 2 kb 482 at 498 the continued existence of that distinction means that the task of identifying transactions as related to either income or capital becomes a live issue in many cases 17 this matter is one such case as i have already noted the applicant originally characterised the loss from the sale of the relevant land as capital but subsequently and now before the court claims that the loss was revenue according to ordinary principles there was no issue in contention that the loss was deductible according to statutory concepts of revenue 18 the traditional delineation between income and capital so far as referable to outgoings was described by dixon j in sun newspapers ltd v federal commissioner of taxation 1938 hca 72 1939 61 clr 337 at 359 363 as follows the distinction between expenditure and outgoings on revenue account and on capital account corresponds with the distinction between the business entity structure or organization set up or established for the earning of profit and the process by which such an organisation operates to obtain regular returns by means of regular outlay the difference between the outlay and returns representing profit or lossthere are i think three matters to be considered a the character of the advantage sought and in this its lasting qualities may play a part b the manner in which it is to be used relied upon or enjoyed and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part and c the means adopted to obtain it that is by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment these principles have been considered and applied many times by australian courts see for example

later in this judgment capital or revenue and real property 20 real property is commonly regarded as a capital asset generally speaking unless a sale of real property is made in the operation of a business the resulting profit will not be income according to the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind the courts have historically addressed the issue of whether a gain made by a taxpayer in relation to the sale of what would otherwise be a capital asset was capital or income in terms of whether the taxpayer was merely realising the asset in which case the gain is characterised as a capital gain or whether the gain was made in the operation of business in carrying out a scheme of profitmaking in which case the gain is characterised as income or revenue see for example california

capital assets generated as profit components of profitmaking schemes were capable of constituting income equally clearly the decision is not authority for the proposition that all gains made by business entities are assessable income as pointed out by the full court of the federal court in commissioner of taxation cth v spedley securities ltd 1988 19 atr 938 at 942 such a proposition would be contrary to authority to the act itself and to basic concepts concerning the distinction between capital and income note similar comments by the hill j in cooling 22 fcr at 55 and again by hill j

motivation nor that their activities were not entirely criminal in nature his honour was satisfied that the tribunal dealt with the material correctly 14 on the basis of those findings which i have sought to summarise the federal magistrate dismissed the appellants application for curial review of the tribunals decision i have difficulty with the proposition that the appellant husbands fear of persecution could not have arisen in the evidentiary context he postulated notwithstanding the confinement of his political exposure to that of a media advisor to a politician but seemingly that measure of concern on my part is not strictly necessary or essential to my decisionmaking 15 on 25 may 2006 the appellants filed a notice of appeal to the federal court which framed three grounds of asserted error on the part of the federal magistrate the same being supported by particulars during the hearing of the appeal to this court on 9 november 2006 the appellants sought to rely on an amended notice of appeal that comprehensively amended notice of appeal contained the following grounds and particulars thereto 1 his honour committed an error of law in dismissing the appeal from a decision of the second respondent in circumstances where the second respondent failed to comply with section 4301c of the migration act 1958 thereby committing jurisdictional error by not having regard to probative material particulars a the tribunal found there is no credible evidence to support the applicants claim that either the assault on him in 1997 or the assault and theft in 1999 or the alleged assault in march 2004 was politically rather than criminally motivated b the second respondent had regard to the departments file which includes the protection visa application and other material including that supplied by the applicant c the applicant supplied various media reports including a newspaper article in the island entitled stage director assaulted by gang in which it was reported that the appellant had been mercilessly assaulted by an armed gang alleged to be supporters of an organiser of the peoples alliance who allegedly said to the appellant what was done to laxshr sic would be done to you d in making a finding that there is no credible evidence to support the allegation of politically motivated attack on the appellant the tribunal either failed to have regard to such information andor if it did it did not give reasons why that particular piece of critical corroborative evidence was not credible cf section 4301c of the act 2 his honour further erred in upholding the second respondents decision in circumstances where the second respondent constructively failed to exercise jurisdiction and act judicially when making a critical finding as to the nature of persecution faced by the appellant particulars a the appellant repeats particulars to ground 1 b by its failure to take into account relevant material corroborating the appellants claim of a politically motivated attack on him in 1999 the second respondent constructively failed to consider the appellants claim c the second respondent also failed to act judicially by interpreting the proper test of what amounts to persecution too narrowly by limiting its assessment of the nature of the 1999 assault on the appellant by reference to the appellants political opinion as opposed to whether the attack on the appellant was politically motivated 3 his honour further erred in upholding the second respondents decision in circumstances where the second respondent failed to consider an integer of the appellants claim particulars a at the hearing before the tribunal the appellant said that the real death threats took place after the former foreign minister changed political parties the applicant said that he was seen on television on 1 may 2004 and from that moment he received real threats b the tribunal then reminded the appellant that the only matter raised by him in the complaints he had lodged with the police related to the threats arising from the 1999 videotaping incident and that his claimed fear of persecution arising from his political opinion was difficult to accept c however in his statutory declaration dated 27 january 2005 sent to the tribunal after the hearing the appellant referred to his evidence at the hearing and reiterated that the alleged death threat he received was not a criminal act because i received threats since i changed my parties and political opinion d in the preceding circumstances it was incumbent on the tribunal to consider the claim that arose from the evidence whether or not explicitly pleaded e it appears the tribunal considered the claim as articulated in the police complaints report in relation to the 1999 videotaping incident f the tribunal therefore constructively failed to consider an integer of the appellants claim 16 in the context of the grounds the subject of that amended notice of appeal counsel for the minister submitted that the minister does not consent to the appellant lodging an amended notice of appeal but accepts that the prejudice the minister has suffered could be remedied by a costs order the minister therefore requested that leave to amend be subject to an order that the appellants pay the ministers costs thrown away counsel for the minister further submitted that s 430 of the migration act 1958 cth the act was now being relied upon in substitution for the s 424a ground contained in the original notice of appeal and that being so all im asking foris that having put in their submission late we did the reasonable thing to make our submission to be prepared on time they changed the case and we should get costs thrown away that submission is correct in principle but whether or not any significant amount of legal costs were in effect thrown away may well be in reality debateable and would be a matter for the courts assessment officer who undertakes the taxation process in the somewhat complex circumstances of this case the submission would not be a necessary given 17 counsel for the minister emphasised further complaint in particular in relation to the third ground the subject of the amended notice of appeal which the minister contended to be a new ground and submitted that leave should be refused as it was not run below and was a weak ground however both parties addressed the court on the merits or lack of merit thereof in any event the view i have reached is not anchored to that third ground 18 in relation to the first ground of appeal the appellants submitted that the tribunal did not pay realistic regard to the relevant newspaper article in that the tribunal failed to give reasons why it did not find material contained in that article to be of probative value to the appellants claim the newspaper article which appeared in the sri lankan newspaper the island is reproduced in part below stage director assault by gang a prominent stage play

18907,46,2,143,120,19300,the last in time argument is novel it has not been considered expressly by any court previously it is based on the principle of surrender by implication that principle has been applied as the doctrine of incompatible offices in cases such as egan v maher no 2 1978 35 flr 252 at 263 mellor v horn 1988 25 ir 157 at 159 161 and johnson v beitseen 1989 41 ir 395 at 412 413 in re cholosznecki re communications electrical electronic energy information postal plumbing and allied services union 2006 fca 452 2006 151 ir 218 the principle of implied surrender was applied in determining that a member of an organisation had surrendered her membership of one of its branches by applying to become and being accepted and treated as a member of another branch where membership of more than one branch was expressly prohibited by the rules the principle operates by implication of law rather than by implied intention the intention is imputed to a person as a result of the assumption of a second position incompatible with the first to relinquish the first position the principle is subject to the express provisions of the rules but not easily displaced by them because it has been held to apply even where there were express mandatory provisions about resignation the principle of implied surrender is analysed in cholosznecki at 29 34 in the present case counsel for mr reid and mr wisniewski contended that r 55 does nothing more than to bring forward the operation of the doctrine of incompatible offices to the stage where nominations for offices occur he argued that just as the assumption of a second office incompatible with one already held is taken to be an implied resignation of the first office so the lodging of a second nomination incompatible with one already lodged is taken to be the implied withdrawal of the first nomination 20 having considered the arguments and the available authorities i am of the view that the last in time argument is correct the doctrine of incompatible offices is but an example of the broader principle of surrender by implication this was made clear by willes j in the case to which the doctrine of incompatible offices has been traced iron ship coating co ltd v blunt 1868 lr 3 cp 484 at 488 the principle itself is related to the common law doctrine of election between inconsistent rights this relationship was explored in the judgment of northrop j with whom evatt j agreed in egan at 263 264 where his honour referred to tropical traders ltd v goonan 1964 hca 20 1964 111 clr 41 and sargent v asl developments ltd 1974 hca 40 1974 131 clr 634 in tropical traders at 55 kitto j with whom taylor and menzies jj agreed said not that election is a matter of intention it is an effect which the law annexes to conduct which would be justifiable only if an election had been made one way or the other this view was followed by stephen j in sargent at 646 also in sargent at 656 mason j said in some instances election may take place as a matter of conscious choice with knowledge of the existence of the alternative right and in other cases it may occur when the law attributes the character of an election to the conduct of a party 22 it is no answer to this line of argument to say that at the time when it arrives the later nomination is invalid because of the former as northrop j evatt j agreeing smithers j dissenting on this point made clear in egan at 262 the inconsistent assumption of rights does not have to be valid in order to constitute an implied surrender of the original right in that case the holder of the office of national assistant secretary of an organisation accepted appointment to the office of national secretarytreasurer on the assumption that there was a vacancy in the latter office the court held that in law there was no vacancy in the office of national secretarytreasurer but the officer concerned was nonetheless taken to have resigned impliedly from his position as national assistant secretary in any event in a case such as the present there is no particular ground for holding that a second or subsequent nomination is invalid when it is received all that can be said is that there have been two acts of the candidate which cannot stand together because of the operation of r 55 as a logical proposition it is equally open to say that the second nomination invalidates the first as it is to say that the first nomination invalidates the second i have come to the conclusion that the principle of implied surrender requires that the law take the view that it is the first nomination that is surrendered impliedly by the lodging of the second the first becomes invalid not the second the adoption of such a proposition does not offend on policy grounds policy is blind to the relative importance of the two or more positions for which nominations have been received and to the personalities of those who have been nominated no greater inconvenience is caused

19609,85,8,25,5,46770,while the structure of the trust deed and schedule c is such that in the circumstances mr kowalski had some entitlement to be paid a sum out of the fund the deed did not give him any absolute entitlement to be paid a tpd benefit as such for such a benefit to be payable the trustee had to determine whether mr kowalski fell within the definition of total and permanent disablement in cl 16 of the trust deed part b of that definition required the trustee to form an opinion as to whether mr kowalski was incapacitated to such an extent as to render him unlikely ever to engage or work for reward in any occupation for which he is reasonably suited by education training or experience the cl 16 determination and the opinion embedded in it were ones for the trustee not the court see ford and lee principles of the law of trusts 5185 and the cases cited therein accordingly absent a favourable determination by the trustee it cannot be said as mr kowalski claims in his pleading that he has an entitlement to a tpd benefit but cf minehan v agl employees superannuation pty ltd 1998 134 actr 1 at 68 where the court itself executed the trust a rare event 18 again the pleading alleges repeated failures by the trustee to consider any of the medical evidence that was available to it and hence whether he was entitled to a tpd benefit assuming that there were times at which a duty to consider so arose the most that mr kowalski could expect from a court by way of relief if any would be a direction to the trustee to consider whether in the circumstances a cl 16 determination should be made and this on the basis of an unreasonable and culpable failure to consider the matter mr kowalski does not seek such relief in this proceeding 21 there is now a significant body of australian case law dealing with challenges to the decisions of superannuation trustees not to provide a particular benefit to a member because the trustee has determined that the member did not fall within the relevant trust definition for that benefit many of these cases have involved claims for total and permanent disability benefits having criteria similar to those embodied in cl 16 see eg jeffrey guy baker v local government superannuation scheme pty ltd 2007 nswsc 1173 hay v total risk management pty ltd 2004 nswsc 94 sayseng v kellogg superannuation pty ltd 2003 nswsc 945 flegeltaub v telstra super pty ltd 2000 vsc 107 minehan v agl employees superannuation pty ltd vidovic v email superannuation pty ltd unreported supreme court of new south wales bryson j 3 march 1995
3210,1,17,257,46,1717,in aon risk services australia limited v australian national university 2009 hca 27 the high court revisited the question of late applications for amendment of pleadings and the relevance to such applications of the powers and principles of casemanagement the high court reversed the order of the primary judge allowing the plaintiff to make substantial amendments to its claim at the start of the trial at 92 gummow hayne crennan kiefel and bell jj referred to the fact that casemanagement is now an accepted aspect of the system of civil justice administered by courts in australia at 98 their honours said with reference to the rule of court conferring casemanagement powers on the supreme court of the australian capital territory of course a just resolution of proceedings remains the paramount purpose of r 21 but what is a just resolution is to be understood in light of the purposes and objectives stated speed and efficiency in the sense of minimum delay and expense are seen as essential to a just resolution of proceedings this should not detract from a proper opportunity being given to the parties to plead their case but it suggests that limits may be placed upon repleading when delay and cost are taken into account the rules reference to the need to minimise costs implies that an order for costs may not always provide sufficient compensation and therefore achieve a just resolution it cannot therefore be said that a just resolution requires that a party be permitted to raise any arguable case at any point in the proceedings on payment of costs at 111 their honours concluded an application for leave to amend a pleading should not be approached on the basis that a party is entitled to raise an arguable claim subject to payment of costs by way of compensation there is no such entitlement all matters relevant to the exercise of the power to permit an amendment should be weighed the fact of substantial delay and wasted costs the concerns of case management will assume importance on an application for leave to amend statements in jl holdings which suggest only a limited application for case management do not rest upon a principle which has been carefully worked out in a significant succession of cases on the contrary the statements are not consonant with this courts earlier recognition of the effects of delay not only upon the parties to the proceedings in question but upon the court and other litigants such statements should not be applied in the future the present case is not one concerning a late application for amendment of pleadings in many senses it is more serious it is a case of repeated refusals not merely failures to comply with orders of the court requiring the appellants to make discovery of documents and to allow ms wangs solicitor to inspect their discovered documents mr lee had persisted with a demand for payment as a precondition for providing inspection of documents despite advice from his own solicitor that this was not a course open to him even in the face of deadlines specified by the federal magistrate for the performance of obligations under earlier orders mr lee proposed leisurely timetables for the performance of those obligations and a further adjournment of the trial which had already been adjourned once the circumstances in which the appellants had ceased to be represented by their solicitor were never revealed making it more difficult for them to rely on lack of representation as a factor justifying the adjournment of the trial it is significant that despite the lack of representation and mr lees difficulty with english the two affidavits of 7 and 9 april demonstrated to the federal magistrate that mr lee had access to someone who was sufficiently fluent in english and had sufficient understanding of the court processes to produce affidavits in something close to the proper form it would have been open to the federal magistrate to reach the conclusion that mr lee was attempting to postpone an inevitable judgment against the appellants on ms wangs claim and that the need to visit his father in china was raised as part of such an attempt the fact that the federal magistrate was kinder to mr lee than he needed to be by not making such a finding should not lead to a successful appeal from the exercise of the federal magistrates discretion if the powers given by rules of court to give judgment against a defaulting party were never to be exercised because of a supposed principle that judgment for a large sum of money should not be given without a trial the grants of express powers by rules would be hollow casemanagement would be deprived of its only real sanction against a party who while resisting a claim for a substantial sum of money defaults persistently in complying with orders of a court the framers of rr 1303a and 1303b of the federal magistrates court rules cannot have intended that those rules should be subject to such a principle that would enable a party against whom a substantial monetary claim is made to defend that claim by failing persistently to take steps necessary to bring the claim on for trial any principle derived from freeman is much more limited than that suggested by counsel for the appellants freeman is best regarded as turning on its particular circumstances and as belonging to an era before the broad adoption of casemanagement principles as the recent judgment in aon shows casemanagement principles have assumed a greater importance than they were thought to have had even as recently as 1997 when jl holdings was decided it is clear from the second passage i have quoted from aon in 36 above that the principle stated in jl holdings should no longer be followed if there remains a narrower principle derived from freeman than that suggested by counsel for the appellants such a principle could not be applicable in the present case there is no injustice in judgment for a large sum of money against heng v and mr lee having regard to mr lees apparent determination not to comply with repeated orders requiring him to produce for inspection all of the appellants discoverable documents conclusion

2111,62,32,474,222,6930,counsel relied on appellant s3952002 v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs 2003 hca 71 2003 216 clr 473 and argued that although the tribunal might have been entitled to examine the appellants living circumstances in china and reach the conclusion that no past persecution had in fact occurred the absence of past persecution did not mean that there was not a real chance of persecution in the future he argued that the tribunal paid little to no attention to the risks of the appellant suffering persecution upon her return to china 25 the federal magistrate agreed that the tribunal had dismissed the question of future persecution quite summarily however his honour pointed out that no evidence had been produced to indicate that the appellant would behave any differently in the future to how she had in the past and concluded it would in those circumstances be an otiose exercise having reached conclusions about past activities not having led to persecution for the tribunal to expressly posit such activities happening in the future and then make findings based on a prognostication of future events when it was given no basis for considering that future activities would be any different or the response of the authorities any more persecutory in these circumstances the tribunal can only find as here that no chance of serious harm on account of such activities will occur in the reasonably foreseeable future 26 his honour therefore dismissed the appellants application for judicial review 27 the appellants notice of appeal raises several grounds of appeal the first three challenge the federal magistrates conclusions on the tribunals findings in relation to the issue of future persecution asserting that his honour erred in holding that a the tribunals failure to assess a risk of future persecution did not amount to jurisdictional error b it was not required to examine the issue despite the appellant not giving evidence as to any difference in future behaviour and c the tribunal was not required to make findings relating to this question and that their absence did not amount to the tribunal asking the wrong question by focusing on any persecution the appellant may have suffered in the past rather than the future 28 the notice of appeal also challenges the federal magistrates conclusion in dismissing the claim of jurisdictional error in that the tribunals findings regarding the appellants claimed fear of persecution for reasons of religion and in particular its failure to consider whether restrictions on public worship amounted to persecution 29 finally it is asserted in the notice of appeal that the federal magistrate erred in concluding that the tribunal had properly considered the appellants claim for fear of persecution on the basis of a political opinion imputed to her by reason of her sons political activities in australia and had properly taken into account the fact of the grant of a protection visa to the appellants son in its consideration 30 during argument the appellants counsel applied for leave to amend a further ground of appeal directed to the passage in the tribunals reasons referred to in 8 of these reasons counsel asked for time to consider the precise wording of the amendment i directed the appellant to formulate the amendment within 7 days and each party to provide me with written submissions in relation to the application for leave to amend and the substance of the amendment the parties complied 31 whilst the first respondent argued that the ground should be dismissed no separate argument was put that leave should not be given the ground of appeal for which leave was sought is 4 the learned federal magistrate erred in not holding that the tribunal had 41 upon finding that the repression of the uighers stems deeper than mere disadvantage as they are being deliberately persecuted for practising and preserving their culture and religion 42 committed jurisdictional error by not considering whether in light of that finding the appellant as an uigher person would therefore also be persecuted if she were to return to china 32 it would be appropriate in the circumstances of this appeal to grant leave to amend in the absence of any objection by the first respondent and because the ground is related to the first ground and because in my opinion the ground should be upheld 45 the respondent further submitted that no error of the type referred to in appellant s3952002 216 clr 473 arose because the tribunal focused on the appellants particular circumstances the first respondent argued that the federal magistrate correctly held that the tribunal was properly engaged in the task of identifying whether a wellfounded fear of serious harm had been established rather than attempting to apply it submitted an inappropriate test as to what constitutes religious persecution 46 the respondent submitted that the federal magistrate was correct in dealing with the tribunals decision regarding the appellants son and that no error was apparent in his honours decision and ground 3 should be dismissed 47 the first respondent contended that the appellants lateraised fourth ground of appeal should be dismissed the first respondent submitted that properly read the passage of the tribunals reasons did not mean that the tribunal accepted as fact that all uighers are being deliberately persecuted rather it submitted the tribunal was reciting an assertion of information provided by amnesty international it therefore submitted that no jurisdictional error arose from this passage of the tribunals decision 48 there are four reasons why in my opinion this appeal should be allowed and the orders made by the federal magistrate set aside and orders made for the issue of the constitutional writs 49 first in my opinion contrary to the finding of the federal magistrate the tribunal did not address the appropriate question in considering the appellants claims the question that the tribunal needed to consider was whether the appellant had a wellfounded fear of persecution this required the tribunal to consider whether if the appellant were to return to her country of origin in this case china there would be a real chance she would be persecuted for a convention reason 51 however a finding that she has not previously been subject to persecution for a convention reason does not necessarily answer the question as to whether there is a real chance that she will be subject to persecutory conduct in the future if she were to return to china for a convention reason appellant s3952002 216 clr 473 per gummow and hayne jj at 499 52 in this case the tribunal addressed the question of past conduct but did not consider the question of future conduct that specific question had to be addressed and answered in that sense it did not exercise the jurisdiction which is bestowed upon it under the act 53 the second reason why in my opinion the tribunal fell into error is that the tribunal did not address one integer of the appellants claim she claimed that by reason of her husbands conduct her soninlaws conduct and more relevantly her sons conduct their political opinions would be imputed to her which would give rise to persecutory conduct on the part of the authorities the tribunal did not consider whether her sons conduct and the granting of a protection visa to him as a result of the decision of the tribunal would be likely to give rise to persecution for their political opinions the tribunal misunderstood the relevance of the appellants son being granted a protection visa 54 thirdly in my opinion the tribunal fell into error by failing to deal properly with the appellants claims of feared persecution because of her religious beliefs there was significant evidence put before the tribunal as to the manner in which the appellant was restricted by the chinese state in the practice of her religion and also as to the manner in which she wished to practice her religion namely in public with other members of the muslim community despite this the tribunal held that the applicant has not claimed that she was effectively prevented from practising her religion in private she made no claim that she suffered persecution or came to the attention of the authorities on the basis of her religion

21086,10,10,381,338,46931,on the substantive issues raised in the review application under s 522 of the act it was a matter for the respondents as to whether they sought to crossexamine the appellant on his affidavits they did not do so the respondents affidavits which preceded 30 march 2005 put the appellant on notice as to their case and gave him the opportunity to respond the judgment was made that the rule in browne v dunn 1893 6 r 67 had been satisfied the appellant has made no submission of unfairness in that regard 78 the appellants wish to crossexamine in particular ms langford and the second respondent related directly to the issue of solvency to a significant degree the learned magistrate in fact avoided addressing contentious factual issues he expressly assumed in favour of the appellant that the 212 shares in manna hill were the appellants shares he also disregarded the costs liability arising from the costs order following the outcome of the earlier proceedings 79 the assessment of the appellants debts as being between 75000 and 100000 was made as the reasons for judgment show upon the basis of the statement of affairs and the appellants evidence as distinct from his submissions about that the oriley debt was about 12000 so the reduction from the debts listed in the statement of affairs having regard to the appellants evidence was of the order of 320007000 that did not involve any assessment of the respective claims of the appellant and ms langford as to the amount of his debt to her the disputed evidence was referred to and the magistrate simply observed that the indebtedness is somewhere between 15000 the appellants figure and 67000 ms langfords figure the reasons do not suggest an amount greater than 15000 was taken into account the learned magistrate has therefore on that contested evidence taken the view based upon the appellants own material in that circumstance he did not deprive the appellant of a fair trial by not permitting the appellant to crossexamine ms langford there was no benefit to the appellant in him doing so as the crossexamination would have legitimately sought to have the magistrate accept the fact as to the amount of the indebtedness which the magistrate assumed in any event
13571,95,34,201,126,46171,according to tpi it was on the basis of the applicants written submissions that it prepared its own written submissions to meet the applicants assumed case however on the morning of the hearing on 26 march 2008 senior counsel for the applicant without any prior warning to the other parties or the court abandoned the issue estoppel argument instead tpi submitted the applicant reformulated its case in oral argument and put it on two quite different bases the applicant relied firstly on what senior counsel for the ncc had said to kenny j when her honour delivered judgment in hamersley iron pty ltd v national competition council 1999 fca 867 1999 164 alr 203 secondly it relied on what was said to be the proper construction of the declaratory orders thereafter made by her honour 7 tpi says that the applicants case before me was conducted on this new basis and that the evidence and written submissions of all parties were thereafter rendered almost entirely irrelevant moreover further written submissions were required to be filed by all parties in response to these newly identified issues it is for that reason that tpi claims that it should be fully indemnified for the substantial costs that it incurred in preparing to meet a case that was commenced particularised and articulated in written submissions but then abandoned without warning on the morning of the hearing tpi accepts that the costs of the hearing itself and the supplementary submissions that it had to file to meet the applicants new case should be ordered against the applicant on the usual partyparty basis 8 in the alternative tpi submits that the applicants issue estoppel case was always clearly foredoomed to fail logically the res judicata point had to fail as well once issue estoppel was abandoned since the latter so it was said was a necessary condition for the existence of the former 12 the applicant argues that the issue regarding the construction of kenny js orders was always part of its case and did not involve a newly identified issue it refers to correspondence from its solicitors to the ncc in which the solicitors referred to the ncc being bound by kenny js orders its own outline of submissions plainly flagged the construction argument by referring repeatedly to the actual terms of her honours orders the issue regarding the construction of those orders was intertwined with whether res judicata was applicable 13 the applicant concedes that it abandoned issue estoppel however it submits that this is not a sufficient basis for ordering indemnity costs if it were indemnity costs would be ordered routinely and parties and their legal advisers would be tempted to pursue all issues to judgment rather than face the prospect of indemnity costs for abandoning an issue no longer regarded as tenable the applicant says that the abandonment of issue estoppel should not be taken as a concession that the doctrine had been unreasonably or improperly raised 14 the applicant says that its res judicata claim was not one that had no chance of success a point amply illustrated by the detailed treatment i gave this claim in my reasons for judgment nor was the issue estoppel claim necessarily foredoomed to fail indeed the fourth undertaking proffered to the full court made express reference to a possible contention that kenny js orders gave rise to an issue estoppel this was said in response to concerns expressed by goldberg j that an issue estoppel might arise 15 finally the applicant says that another factor weighing against tpis application for indemnity costs is that it sought and obtained by consent leave to be joined as a respondent to the proceeding in circumstances where the ncc was a perfectly able contradictor and tpi made many submissions that duplicated those of the ncc 19 the applicants additional submission based upon counsels assurance to kenny j at the time her honour delivered judgment had to be addressed as indeed it was however the failure of this point should be the subject of an order for costs on a party and party basis and does not warrant an order for indemnity costs 20 for these reasons i will order as foreshadowed that the applicant pay the respondents costs to be taxed in default of agreement there will be no order for indemnity costs i certify that the preceding twenty 20 numbered paragraphs are

14564,94,2,434,32,33017,submitted that this court should hold that there has been no imputed waiver because the commonwealth has made no attempt to identify why it would be unfair or inequitable for awb to maintain privilege in the underlying investigations this submission immediately raises the question unfair or inequitable to whom i doubt that any question arises of fairness to the commission it is an arm of the executive government charged with the investigation of specified matters nor does any question arise of fairness to the commonwealth fairness presupposes a balancing of interests between parties who are in dispute in that context partial disclosures raise a question of fairness because there is the capacity to mislead one party to the dispute to his or her detriment these concepts do not translate easily to the present case cf mchugh j in mann at 40 127128 there is also the difficulty that outside the framework of an inter partes dispute fairness is truly a term of indeterminate reference mann at 40 129 per mchugh j citing rj desiatnik legal professional privilege in australia 1999 p 122 133 mann anticipated that there will be cases in which considerations of fairness have little or no role to play this is such a case the broad question posed by mann is whether and to what extent awbs disclosures are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the documents which are at issue in these proceedings this question wraps up several subsidiary issues in particular whether awbs disclosures involved on each occasion a disclosure of the gist or substance of its legal advice whether awb consciously deployed that advice so as to advance its own commercial or other interests and if so whether that disclosure has resulted in an imputed waiver of privilege over any and what associated materials in any application of mann the starting point must be an analysis of the disclosures or other acts or omissions of the party claiming privilege that are said to be inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the privileged material see rio tinto at 45 the disclosures in question here were made variously to the iic to the australian government to the commission and in some instances via the procedures of the commission to the public at large in my opinion there is no reason why these disclosures cannot support a finding that awb has waived legal professional privilege over associated material awb submitted that imputed waiver cannot arise in the context of a commission established under the rca alternatively it submitted that the coercive and inquisitorial context in which the alleged waiver has taken place is an important factor which strongly militates against waiver these submissions ignore the voluntary disclosures that awb made to the australian government in any event i am not persuaded that awbs disclosures to the commission and the iic are incapable of giving rise to an imputed waiver leaving aside any question of waiver awb was entitled to maintain legal professional privilege in the course of proceedings before the commission and by and large it sought to do so to the extent that awb has already produced documents to the commission containing legal advice or instructions it did so because it recognised that actions it had taken outside the commission had the consequence of waiving privilege over those documents as for the oral evidence that the commonwealth now relies upon lindberg cooper and scales were senior executives of awb when they gave that evidence to the commission there is nothing before me to suggest that they were not speaking as executives of awb when they gave their evidence or that their evidence fell outside the scope of their authority from awb further their evidence was given in the presence of awbs legal representatives without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege lindberg cooper and scales may have been compelled to give evidence at the commission but they were under no compulsion to reveal the gist or substance of legal advice that had been obtained by awb in these circumstances i infer that the relevant evidence given by lindberg cooper and scales was given with the authority or acquiescence of awb i also infer that awb was content for the evidence to be given at public hearings of the commission having regard to its own commercial interests the evidence before me makes it clear that awb was concerned to defend its integrity and commercial reputation in the course of the commissions hearings i infer that awb made the assessment that it would advance its commercial interests if it were to be known publicly that it had undertaken extensive legal reviews and that as a result it had obtained legal advice that there was no evidence that it had engaged in any improper or unlawful conduct in breach of the united nations sanctions awb was content for information of this character to be disclosed publicly in relation to both project rose and project water it would of course be a different case if the documents and information that the commonwealth relies upon were disclosed under legal compulsion on any view the fact that documents and information were disclosed under compulsion would be very relevant to the question whether the person claiming privilege had engaged in inconsistent conduct there is moreover authority to the effect that a production of documents or evidence under compulsion will not result in any waiver of privilege goldman v hesper 1988 1 wlr 1238 goldman trans america computer co inc v ibm corporation 573 f2d 646 9 th cir 1978 trans america at 651 awbs disclosures to the iic were not made under legal compulsion they were made by choice under a confidentiality regime negotiated by awb the memorandum of understanding between awb and the iic provided that awb could withhold documents from the iic on grounds of commercial sensitivity or legal professional privilege or if there was a risk that awb its officers or employees would be exposed to breaches of australian law it also provided that any interviews conducted by the iic of awb officers or employees could be undertaken in the presence of a personal legal counsel andor up to two representatives of awb awb thereby retained the right to object to any question that intruded into areas protected by legal professional privilege on the evidence before me including in particular the various briefings which hargreaves gave to the australian government it is clear that awb decided that it needed to cooperate and be seen to cooperate with the iic so as to retain the support of the australian government and to protect and defend its commercial reputation i do not agree with awbs submission that even if its disclosures were not compelled by law the inquisitorial context in which they took place is a factor which strongly militates against waiver in australia legal professional privilege is a fundamental common law right that can be asserted outside the context of adversarial litigation it can for instance be invoked to resist the production of documents in answer to a search warrant or the giving of information or the production of documents pursuant to coercive statutory powers or notices daniels at 552553 9 11 and 563 44 baker v campbell 1983 hca 39 1983 153 clr 52 as legal professional privilege can be invoked outside the context of judicial or quasijudicial proceedings logic suggests that it should be capable of being waived if the claimant engages in conduct that is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect it should not matter whether the conduct takes place within or outside the framework of the proceedings or investigatory process in which a demand has been made for the production of privileged documents or information the crucial question is whether the conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality the disclosure of privileged communications to a third party can result in an imputed waiver of privilege even if there is no intention of waiving privilege and the disclosure is for a limited and specific purpose in mann the chief minister of the australian capital territory conveyed legal advice on a confidential basis to a member of the territorys legislative assembly to enable him to consider the reasonableness of the governments decision to settle certain legal proceedings the majority decision turned on the fact that the disclosure to a member of the legislative assembly was not regarded as disclosure to a third party in their joint judgment gleeson cj gaudron gummow and callinan jj said at 15 35 that the purpose of the privilege being to protect the territory from subsequent disclosure of the legal advice it received concerning the litigation instituted by the appellant there was nothing inconsistent with that purpose in the chief minister conveying the terms of that advice on a confidential basis to a member of the legislative assembly who wished to consider the reasonableness of the conduct of the territory in relation to the litigation however their honours also observed that while the voluntary disclosure of privileged legal advice to a third party will not necessarily waive privilege it can do so they said that goldberg v ng illustrates that depending on the circumstances the disclosure of a privileged communication to a third party for a limited and specific purpose and on terms as to confidentiality can have the consequence of waiving privilege mchugh j dissented in his view any disclosure of privileged material to a third party who is a stranger to the privileged relationship ie to a person who is not the lawyer or the client should have the consequence that privilege in that material is waived as against the world at 34 108 3738 118 42 133134 as i read his honours judgment the key reason why his honour preferred a bright line rule of this kind is that it would ensure that legal professional privilege was not extended beyond the rationales that support it at 37 117118 ensuring candid communications between a lawyer and a client is unlikely to be endangered if a privilege holder is held to waive privilege because he or she has voluntarily disclosed the communication to a stranger whether the communication will be disclosed in the future to a stranger to the privilege is entirely within the control of the client at that stage the client will determine whether his or her interests are best served by retaining the privilege or disclosing the communication but it is difficult to see how the possibility of voluntary disclosure will prevent the client being candid with his or her lawyer a client who voluntarily discloses privileged information to a stranger to the privileged relationship has made a choice based no doubt on considerations personal to him or her that the purpose for which the communication is disclosed to the stranger is more important than protecting the absolute confidentiality of the communication by preventing the stranger from having knowledge of it the person may be encouraged to do so as in goldberg v ng by an expectation that the stranger will not further disclose the communication but in my opinion if privileged material is voluntarily disclosed to a stranger to the privileged relationship the fact that it may be received under an obligation of confidence should not be relevant to whether privileged is waived on the facts mchugh j considered that disclosure to a member of the legislative assembly who was not a member of the executive government was relevantly a disclosure to a stranger to the privileged relationship at 44 139 in goldberg v ng the respondents sued their solicitor goldberg for failure to account for monies received and disbursed by him as their solicitor they also made a professional conduct complaint against him to the law society of new south wales in answer to the complaint goldberg prepared statements with annexures that included a draft brief to counsel and submitted them to the societys professional conduct department in doing so goldberg told the society that the statements and the annexures were confidential and he wished to retain his legal professional privilege in them the society dismissed the complaint on the ground that there was no evidence of professional misconduct or unsatisfactory professional conduct subsequently in the course of the supreme court proceedings instituted by the respondents against goldberg the respondents served a subpoena on the society requiring it to produce documents relating to the complaint against goldberg all of the members of the high court held that there had been no express or intentional waiver by goldberg of his legal professional privilege in the statements and annexures the issue that divided the court was whether waiver should be imputed by operation of law deane dawson and gaudron jj held at 100102 that it should because the professional complaint and the supreme court proceedings were but different emanations of the one dispute and goldbergs provision of the statements to the society was voluntary and for the calculated purpose of demonstrating the reliability of his denial of the alleged failure to account their honours analysed the issue in terms of fairness but they could equally and perhaps more appropriately have done so in terms of inconsistency toohey and gummow jj dissented in separate judgments each expressed the view that waiver should not be imputed because the disclosures by goldberg were made to a third party for a limited and specific purpose toohey j said at 110 that the following factors militated strongly against any implied or imputed waiver first goldberg disclosed material to the society because of a complaint against him on an undertaking by the society that the contents would be kept confidential secondly the disclosure was made in the context of the societys investigation of a complaint in pursuance of its statutory powers and consequently it could be regarded as having been made for the purposes of the act and thirdly the disclosure was confined to the society gummow j said at 123 that as the disclosures were made in the context of compulsory statutory processes the circumstances of the case supplied no sufficient reason for depriving goldberg of privilege even allowing for the advantage he sought to gain by making the disclosure the case of restom v battenberg 2006 fca 781 provides an example of a case where disclosures to a third party triggered a waiver of legal professional privilege in the course of bankruptcy proceedings the debtor claimed privilege over a letter that passed between his australian and scottish solicitors stone j held that the disclosure of the contents of the letter to the scottish employment tribunal was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the letter and constituted a waiver of privilege in network ten ltd v capital television holdings ltd 1995 36 nswlr 275 which predated goldberg v ng and mann giles j held that a limited and specific disclosure of privileged material on terms of confidentiality did not result in a loss of privilege in australian rugby union ltd v hospitality group pty ltd 1999 165 alr 253 sackville j said that it follows from goldberg v ng that the disclosure of a privileged communication for a limited purpose and subject to a confidentiality requirement may or may not amount to a waiver of privilege depending on the circumstances of the case at 262263 4243 on the facts of that case sackville j held that a disclosure of legal advice to the solicitors and representatives of two other companies on strict terms as to confidentiality and for the purpose of those other companies obtaining legal advice did not result in an imputed waiver his honour distinguished goldberg v ng as a case in which the disclosure was made to gain an advantage over the opposing party in related litigation at 263 45 there are several english cases in which disclosure to a third party for a limited and specific purpose has not resulted in a loss of privilege british coal corporation v dennis rye ltd no 2 1988 1 wlr 1113 british coal goldman and gotha city v southebys no 1 1988 1 wlr 1114 in british coal neill lj with whom stocker lj and dillon lj agreed held that the disclosure of documents by the plaintiff to the police to assist in a criminal investigation and criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege neill lj said at 822 in my judgment the action of the plaintiff in making documents available for the purpose of the criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege to which it was entitled in the present civil proceedings its action in regard to both the category a and the category b documents was in accordance with its duty to assist in the conduct of the criminal proceedings and could not properly be construed as an express or implied waiver of its rights in its own civil litigation indeed it would in my view be contrary to public policy if the plaintiffs action in making the documents available in the criminal proceedings had the effect of automatically removing the cloak of privilege which would otherwise be available to them in the civil litigation for which the cloak was designed in goldman the court of appeal considered the effect of a statutory requirement that a claimant for costs must disclose privileged materials to the courts taxing officers taylor lj with whom woolf lj and lord donaldson mr agreed said that once a party puts forward privileged documents as part of his case for costs the privilege is relaxed temporarily and pro hac vice if the taxing officers felt compelled by natural justice considerations to disclose part or all of the contents of a privileged document to the opposite party that disclosure would be for the purposes of the taxation only and would not amount to a waiver that prevented the owner of the document from reasserting privilege in any subsequent context at 102 mchugh j took a stricter view in giannarelli v wraith no 2 1991 hca 2 1991 171 clr 592 his honour noted that in victoria unlike in england a litigant can refuse to produce documents to the taxing master on the grounds of legal professional privilege however mchugh j said that if the litigant choses to produce privileged documents to the taxing master then the litigant will be taken to have waived privilege and must let the opposing parties see the documents his honour did not countenance any middle course under which privilege could be waived solely for the purposes of the taxation and then reasserted in some other context at 607 the general rule adopted in the united states is that any voluntary disclosure of privileged communications by a client to a third party breaches the confidentiality of the attorneyclient relationship and therefore waives the privilege not only as to the specific communication disclosed but as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter see weil v investmentindicators research and management inc 647 f2d 18 9 th cir 1981 at 24 united states v aronoff 466 fsupp 855 dc ny 1979 at 862 910 in re sealed

review 999 the us courts have also considered whether a disclosure of privileged material to government investigators will have the consequence of waiving privilege in re sealed case the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia considered whether a corporation that had submitted its own investigating counsels report into alleged bribes and improper payments to the internal revenue service and the securities and exchange commission sec pursuant to voluntary disclosure programs had thereby impliedly waived its privilege over documents which were clearly identified in the report the court held that by revealing part of privileged communications to the agencies to gain a commercial advantage the corporation had made a disclosure which was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality accordingly the court held that the corporation had waived privilege as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter the principle applied by the court was that at 818 29 courts need not allow a claim of privilege when the party claiming the privilege seeks to use it in a way that is not consistent with the purpose of the privilege thus since the purpose of the attorneyclient privilege is to protect the confidentiality of attorneyclient communications in order to foster candor within the attorneyclient relationship voluntary breach of confidence or selective disclosure for tactical purposes waives the privilege disclosure is inconsistent with confidentiality and courts need not permit hideandseek manipulation of confidences in order to foster candor the court rejected an argument that waiver should not be imputed because the corporation had disclosed the investigating counsels report for specific and limited purposes only in doing so it declined to follow the decision in diversified industries inc v meredith 572 f2d 596 8 th cir 1977 diversified industries at 611 in which the eighth circuit court of appeals held that disclosures to the sec under a voluntary disclosure program did not constitute a waiver to anyone but the sec it noted that the decision in diversified industries was rejected in permian corp v united states 665 f2d 1215 dc cir 1981 at 12201222 on the ground that it unnecessarily expanded the scope of attorneyclient privilege see also in re weiss 596 f2d 1185 4 th cir 1979 at 1186 like the district

privileged material is produced to a government regulator under compulsion of law putting to one side its provision of mr tracey qcs advices and instructions and its briefings to the australian government awb disputed that the disclosures it made to the iic and the commission disclosed the gist or substance of legal advice that awb obtained as a result of project rose or project water it contended that these disclosures did no more than refer to the existence of legal advice without disclosing its substance alternatively awb argued that the record of lindbergs interview with the iic and the evidence given to the commission by lindberg cooper and scales cannot be related to any particular piece of legal advice other than that provided by mr tracey qc the applicable principles are set out in my decision in awb v cole at 135 139 the authorities draw a distinction between a mere reference to the existence of legal advice which will not usually amount to a waiver and cases in which the gist or substance of the legal advice has been disclosed see maurice at 481 488 and 493 ampolex ltd v perpetual trustee co canberra ltd 1996 hca 15 1996 70 aljr 603 at 607 ampolex ltd v perpetual trustee co canberra ltd 1996 40 nswlr 12 adelaide steamship co ltd v spalvins 1998 81 fcr 360 at 376377 and bennett v chief executive officer of the australian customs service 2004 fcafc 237 2004 140 fcr 101 bennett at 104105 6 9 in bennett the full court tamberlin emmett and gyles jj held that legal representatives of the australian customs service had waived privilege in legal advice by stating openly that they had given advice to customs that a particular regulation did not prohibit public comment by an officer on matters of public administration the trial judge had held that a disclosure of the legal position or stance that a lawyer had advised a client to take was not inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the communication giving the advice the trial judge also appeared to draw a distinction between statements which disclose the conclusion or logical result of legal advice and statements which disclose the content of the legal advice and its reasoning see tamberlin j at 105 10 and gyles j at 118 61 the full court rejected this approach gyles j stated at 119 65 that the voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice to which reference is made including the reasons for the conclusion tamberlin j said at 104 6 in my view it would be inconsistent and unfair having disclosed and used the substance of the advice in this way to now seek to maintain privilege in respect of the relevant parts of that advice which pertain to the expressed conclusion it may perhaps have been different if it had been simply asserted that the client has taken legal advice and that the position which was adopted having considered the advice is that certain action will be taken or not taken in those circumstances the substance of the advice is not disclosed but merely the fact that there was some advice and that it was considered however once the conclusion in the advice is stated together with the effect of it then in my view there is imputed waiver of the privilege the whole point of an advice is the final conclusion this is the situation in this case subsequently tamberlin j was confronted with a case that was very similar to the one he hypothesised in bennett in nine films and television pty ltd v ninox television ltd 2005 65 ipr 442 the applicant contended that the respondents had waived privilege in various legal advices because of the way in which the respondents had publicly referred to the advice tamberlin j held that there had been no waiver he concluded that the mere assertion that advice had been taken and the fact that action is then taken by the client is not sufficient unless the two are linked in such a way that it is apparent that the advice is that specified action should be taken his honour also made the following observations at 446447 26 whilst i accept that in some circumstances a clear disclosure of the bottom line of the advice and the course of conduct taken thereafter may be sufficient to amount to waiver of legal professional privilege i do not think these matters have been established in the present case on a fair and reasonable reading the statement to the effect that senior counsel had been engaged and that he had reviewed matters in detail and that steps were being taken based on his recommendations is not sufficient to amount to a waiver of the legal advice the substance or content of the advice is not disclosed with specificity or clarity questions of waiver are matters of fact and degree and in this instance i am not persuaded that the conduct assertions or admissible evidence are sufficient to warrant the necessary implication that legal professional privilege has been waived the principles discussed in bennett were applied in seven network ltd v news ltd no 12 2006 fca 348 the issue was whether a statement in a discovered document that our legal advice is that the risk of damages being awarded against optus is low had the consequence of waiving privilege in the legal advice that it referred to sackville j held that it did the statement voluntarily disclosed the gist or conclusion of the legal advice at 12 in rio tinto ltd v commissioner of taxation 2005 224 alr 299 the commissioner of taxation filed particulars with the court stating that the commissioner would be relying on specified grounds which have been confirmed by senior tax counsel and supported by ags and opinions obtained from counsel the taxpayer contended that the commissioner had thereby waived privilege in the legal advice of the australian government solicitor and the opinions of counsel sundberg j held that these references voluntarily disclosed the conclusion or substance of the advice and consequently privilege had been waived sundberg js decision went on appeal to the full court but the full courts decision turned on the alternative ground of issue waiver rio tinto at 72 the full court considered that in the particulars the commissioner had made an assertion that put the contents of the documents containing legal advice in issue or necessarily laid them open to scrutiny with the consequence that there was an inconsistency between the making of the assertion and the maintenance of the privilege awb submitted that the reasoning in bennett was unsound particularly the holding that the disclosure of the conclusion stated in legal advice will amount to a waiver of the whole of the advice awb did not refer to any authorities that supported this submission and i reject it in my view it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of the gist substance or conclusion of legal advice will amount to a waiver in respect of the whole of the relevant advice associated material turning to the scope of any imputed waiver it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of privileged documents can result in a waiver of privilege over those documents and associated material the test applied to determine the scope of any waiver of associated material is whether the material that the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the same issue or subject matter maurice at 482 and 484 per gibbs cj 488 per mason and brennan jj and 498 499 per dawson j in maurice gibbs cj said at 482 similarly where a party disclosed a document which contained part only of a memorandum which dealt with a single subjectmatter and then read the document to the judge in the course of opening the case it was held that privilege was waived as to the whole memorandum great atlantic insurance co v home insurance co in that case templeman lj said the rule that privilege relating to a document which deals with one subject matter cannot be waived as to part and asserted as to the remainder is based on the possibility that any use of part of a document may be unfair or misleading that the party who possesses the document is clearly not the person who can decide whether a partial disclosure is misleading or not nor can the judge decide without hearing argument nor can he hear argument unless the document is disclosed as a whole to the other side once disclosure has taken place by introducing part of the document into evidence or using it in court it cannot be erased the same test must be applied in deciding whether the use in legal proceedings of one document impliedly waives privilege in associated material in nea karteria maritime co ltd v atlantic amp great lakes steamship corporation no 2 mustill j dealt with this question and suggested the following test where a party is deploying in court material which would otherwise be privileged the opposite party and the court must have an opportunity of satisfying themselves that what the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the issue in question to allow an individual item to be plucked out of context would be to risk injustice through its real weight or meaning being misunderstood dawson j discussed the authorities at 498499 in geo doland ltd v blackburn robson coates amp co waiver of privilege with respect to a conversation between solicitor and client which took place before litigation was contemplated was held to extend to any other communications in relation to the subjectmatters of the conversation although the implied waiver was held not to cover similar documents which came into existence for the purpose of prosecuting the litigation this decision was not followed in general accident corporation ltd v tanter where a distinction was drawn between the waiver of privilege before a trial and the further waiver of privilege by calling evidence in a trial in the latter situation the waiver was held to extend to the transaction constituted by the privileged communication but not to the subjectmatter of that communication arising upon other privileged occasions general accident corporation ltd v tanter has been criticized for the distinction which it draws between waiver by the tender of evidence of a privileged communication and waiver by the disclosure of the communication in some other way and for the restriction which it places upon the extent of associative waiver see phipson on evidence par 1520 in nea karteria maritime co ltd v atlantic amp great lakes steamship corporation no 2 a broader view was taken by mustill j that where a party chooses to deploy evidence which would otherwise be privileged the court and the opposition must in relation to the issue in question be given the opportunity to satisfy themselves that they have the whole of the material and not merely a fragment this view was approved by the court of appeal in great atlantic insurance co v home insurance co in the united states it has been widely held that voluntary disclosure of the content of a privileged attorney communication constitutes waiver of the privilege with respect to all other such communications upon the same subjectmatter weil v investmentindicators research and management and the cases there cited diotima shipping corp v chase leavitt amp co united states v aronoff in re sealed case awb relied upon the way in which the principle was formulated by the court of appeal in british american tobacco australia services ltd v cowell 2002 vsca 197 2002 7 vr 524 at 564 121 a reference in one letter of advice to an earlier letter of advice does not expose the latter to scrutiny by the other party to litigation merely because legal professional privilege is waived in relation to the former implied waiver is not so generous a doctrine as we apprehend it where legal professional privilege is waived in relation to one piece or part of advice the privilege is impliedly waived in relation to another if and only if that other is necessary to a proper understanding of the first as established by the high court at least since mann v carnell the test in such cases is whether it would be inconsistent for a party to rely upon and so to waive legal professional privilege in respect of the one without also being taken to have waived privilege in respect of the other it is no doubt correct that a mere reference to the existence of legal advice in a disclosed document will not be regarded as a waiver of its contents albeit a different conclusion would follow if the gist substance or conclusion of the legal advice is voluntarily disclosed but with great respect to their honours the proposition concerning waiver of associated material is expressed too narrowly and in a way that is not consistent with the test propounded by the high court in maurice the principle propounded by the court of appeal may work adequately enough in some circumstances particularly where privilege is sought to be maintained over one part of a single piece of legal advice but in other circumstances it will not give effect to the principles explained in maurice a common application of associated material waiver relates to the case where an expert report has been prepared in reliance upon other documents in

honour stated at 17 although in the present case the primary document for which privilege was expressly waived was the advice of counsel i can discern no difference in principle between such an advice and the advice or report of an expert retained for the purpose of the litigation as i have indicated i am satisfied that counsel relied upon instructions which they were given and it would appear relied upon medical reports in a way which influenced the content of the advice which they gave accordingly insofar as there are documents which were relied upon in the preparation of the advice

advice itself and the documents which were used by counsel and which influenced the content of the advice waiver having occurred the fact that the advice was not ultimately tendered is to my mind not relevant having sought an advantage the plaintiff was bound by the course he had taken and accordingly is amenable to producing the relevant documents in response to an appropriate notice to produce

direct evidence on the point he considered that it was difficult to imagine that the disclosures would have occurred against the wishes of the other joint venturers or indeed without their consent in england the principle has been applied to documents which underpin or support expert evidence see dunlop slazenger international ltd v joe bloggs sports limited 2003 edwca civ 901 mayne pharma pty ltd v debiopharm sa 2006 ewhc 164 pat and loreal sa v bellure nv 2006 ewhc 1503 ch several english cases illustrate the practical operation of the principle in nea karteria maritime co ltd v atlantic amp great lakes steamship corporation no 2 1981 com lr 138 nea karteria a lawyer gave evidence that he had conducted an interview on the basis of a list of questions prepared by the plaintiffs lawyers while privilege was waived with respect to the witnesses answers the plaintiffs sought to maintain privilege with respect to the list of questions at 139140 mustill j as his lordship then was held at 140 that privilege over the list of questions had been waived by implication it seems to me that the written questions were so to speak part of the meeting they were in a sense an agenda for the meeting they formed the basis for onehalf of the exchange between the lawyer and the witness evidence to that effect having been given by the lawyer it seems to me that privilege must have been waived for those questions and i think the interests of justice which i believe to underlie the authorities on this part of the case demand that the opposition and the court should have an opportunity to satisfy itself as to the accuracy of the evidence given to the lawyer as to the way in which he conducted the interview mustill j drew a distinction at 140 between the instructions to the lawyer who carried out the questioning and the questions themselves the instructions did not play a part in the meeting did not form part of the body of events upon which the court had to reach conclusions of fact and were merely part of the prior history of those events in r v secretary of state for transport ex parte factortame 1997 9 admin lr 591 at 599 auld lj made the following observations concerning the application of the test stated in nea karteria much depends on whether the party making partial disclosure seeks to represent by so doing that the disclosed documents go to part or the whole of an issue in question the expression used by mustill j in the passage from his judgment in nea karteria that i have cited the issue may be confined to what was said or done in a single transaction or it may be more complex than that and extend over a series of connected events or transactions in each case the question for the court is whether the matters in issue and the document or documents in respect of which partial disclosure has been made are respectively severable so that the partially disclosed material clearly does not bear on matters in issue in respect of which material is withheld the more confined the issue for example as to the content of a single document or conversation the more difficult it is likely to be to withhold by severance part of the document or other documents relevant to the document or conversation in fulham leisure holdings ltd v nicholson graham amp jones 2006 2 all er 599 fulham at 604 11 mann j suggested that it was helpful to approach the application of the test stated in nea karteria in three steps first identify the transaction in respect of which the disclosure has been made secondly ascertain from the nature of the disclosure or other evidence whether the transaction is wider than an advice given on a single occasion if so the whole of the wider transaction must be disclosed and thirdly the disclosure of the whole transaction may make it plain that further disclosure is necessary to avoid unfairness or misunderstanding of what has been disclosed mann j added at 607 18 that once the transaction has been identified the cases show that the whole of the material relevant to that transaction must be disclosed it is not open to a waiving party to say that the transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose the court will determine objectively what the real transaction is so that the scope of the waiver can be determined his lordship also said that the application of these principles will be very fact sensitive and will vary from case to case at 607 19 waiver has been established at 70 to 126 above i set out my findings as to the precise terms in which awb disclosed the results of its legal reviews and legal advice it had obtained to the australian government the iic and the commission overall i am satisfied that by means of these disclosures awb deployed the gist or substance of legal advice it had obtained moreover i am satisfied that awb made a conscious and voluntary decision to deploy this legal advice in its dealings with the australian government the iic and the commission because it considered that it was in its commercial interests to do so these actions are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the legal advice having regard to the nature purpose terms and extent of its disclosures i am also satisfied that awb acted inconsistently with the maintenance of confidentiality over the associated material which underpinned the legal advice while these overall conclusions are relevant and important i have taken the view that it is necessary and appropriate for me to make specific findings as to the nature and consequences of each such disclosure i turn to that task in his various statements to the australian government hargreaves did not merely refer to the existence of legal advice nor did he simply disclose the legal advice which had been obtained by awb from mr tracey qc he described in some detail the findings and conclusions that had been arrived at by awbs own legal review in my opinion hargreaves thereby disclosed to the australian government the gist or substance of legal advice that awb had obtained as at the relevant dates at which he made his disclosures that there was no evidence of 8226 corruption by awb 8226 side payments or after sales payments by awb to the former iraqi regime 8226 any knowledge on the part of awb that alia was connected with the iraqi regime or that payments were being channelled by alia to that regime 8226 any conduct by awb that resulted in breaches of the united nations sanctions 8226 any other wrongdoing or improper conduct by awb in connection with the supply of wheat to iraq under the off programme when hargreaves gave his briefings to officers of the australian government he expressed himself in terms that were apt to refer and which a reasonable listener would have understood as referring to the combined effect of all of the legal advice that awb had received as at the date of the relevant briefing hargreaves would not have been understood as referring only to a particular piece of historical advice regardless of whether it was overtaken or qualified or supported by later advice his assertions purported to represent the current state of affairs hargreaves memorandum of 25 june 2005 makes it quite clear that his statements to the australian government were based upon all of the legal advice awb had obtained and not simply the advice it had obtained from mr tracey qc it cannot be disputed that hargreaves disclosed the substance of the legal advice which blakes provided to awbs board on 25 may 2004 awb has already formed that view and acted on it by producing blakes power point presentation to the commission but in my view the consequence of hargreaves disclosures cannot be confined to blakes advice of 25 may 2004 and mr tracey qcs advices through the remainder of 2004 and until hargreaves had his last meeting with ms carayanides in the period between 16 june 2005 and september 2005 hargreaves met with australian government representatives several times and continued to make assertions that awbs independent legal review had not identified any wrongdoing by awb the evidence shows that blakes and minters continued the legal review in 2004 and 2005 and provided ongoing legal advice to awb it is not open to a waiving party to say that the disclosures relate simply to one advice and not others or that the relevant transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose the court will determine objectively what has been disclosed see fulham at 607 18 hargreaves memorandum of 25 june 2005 makes it plain that he deliberately deployed awbs legal advice in his dealings with the australian government he did so as part of awbs strategy to secure the continued support of the federal government both generally and in relation to awbs dealings with the iic and the united states government hargreaves also deployed the advice in pursuit of the objectives that he set out in his memorandum they included protecting and defending the reputation of awb both within australia and overseas and minimising any attack by us wheat interests on awbs position as the exclusive manager of wheat exports from australia given these strategic objectives it was important for awb to disclose indeed to stress that it had conducted an extensive independent legal review which had found no evidence of any wrongdoing by awb in connection with its exports of wheat to iraq by disclosing its legal advice to secure these objectives awb assumed the risk that it would be held to have waived legal professional privilege in connection with legal advices it obtained in the course of the legal review having regard to the legal principles governing waiver i consider that any legal advice that awb obtained from blakes or minters prior to hargreaves last meeting with ms carayanides on any of the subject matters or relating to any of the issues described at 180 above has been waived by reason of the disclosures made by hargreaves those subject matters and issues are wide enough to encompass the tigris transaction and the iron filings claim if awb obtained legal advice during this period on those subject matters or relating to those issues from persons other than blakes or minters such as abl mr tracey qc or others that advice has also been waived by hargreaves disclosures i am satisfied that the disclosures to the iic involved a disclosure by awb of the gist or substance of legal advice that it had obtained by 28 february 2005 the disclosure occurred at two points first when lindberg was interviewed on 28 february 2005 the interview took place in the presence of awbs legal representative awb had the ability to object to any statements by lindberg that intruded into areas covered by legal professional privilege no objection was raised to lindbergs statement that the legal review conducted by cooper had found nothing that would substantiate claims of fraud or corruption by awb or payments by awb to individuals in the government of iraq secondly awb was directly involved in providing the record of interview as revised by lindberg and awbs lawyers to the iic in my opinion the record of interview describes the gist or substance of legal advice which awb had obtained as a result of its legal review as with hargreaves lindbergs assertions purported to describe the current state of affairs ie as at 28 february 2005 there is no reason to read his assertions as if they were confined to legal advice obtained from mr tracey qc it extends in my view to any legal advice obtained by awb from blakes minters and mr tracey qc and any advice from others prior to 28 february 2005 that deals with the same subject matters or relates to the same issues as the advice that lindberg described i am satisfied that the disclosures to the iic were made deliberately and consciously by awb with a view to obtaining a finding from the iic that awb had not engaged or at least had not knowingly engaged in conduct that involved making payments to the iraqi regime in breach of the united nations sanctions lindberg and awb went out of their way to stress that the company had undertaken a legal review which had found nothing to substantiate claims of fraud corruption or improper payments to the iraqi regime the disclosures were made with the knowledge and intention that they would be referred to by the iic in its final published report accordingly i find that awb consciously and voluntarily deployed its legal advice with the object and intention of furthering the companys commercial and other interests awb contended that the disclosures which lindberg made at his meeting with the minister for foreign affairs on 4 october 2005 were confined to the advice given by mr tracey qc this is a possible interpretation of the departments minute but in my view lindbergs statements are not to be read and would not have been understood so narrowly later in the meeting lindberg said that awb had acted in accordance with the sanctions regime and that this had been supported by legal advice this statement was expressed broadly and was not confined to independent legal advice in my view lindberg disclosed and a reasonable listener would have understood that lindberg was disclosing the gist or substance of all of the legal advice that awb had obtained up to 4 october 2005 in relation to the question whether awb had acted in accordance with the sanctions regime the disclosure extends to mr tracey qcs memorandum of advice dated 22 september 2005 and professor wippmans advice dated 27 september 2005 at the meeting with the minister for foreign affairs lindberg stewart and other representatives of awb were providing awbs answer to the iics draft findings as communicated to awb in the iics letter of 26 september 2005 the minute shows that awbs representatives were very concerned to explain awbs claims of innocence and to secure the governments ongoing support lindberg told the meeting that the iic had ignored awbs explanations and that the socalled evidence relied on by the iic did not support its factual findings in support of these contentions lindberg asserted that awb had legal advice confirming that awb had not acted in contravention of the sanctions regime i infer that awb made a conscious and voluntary decision to deploy this legal advice at the meeting with the minister so as to secure the ongoing support of the australian government in doing so it assumed the risk of any consequential waiver of legal professional privilege in my opinion blakes presentation to awbs board on 25 may 2004 constituted legal advice for the purposes of the doctrine of legal professional privilege awb withdrew its claim of privilege and produced the complete presentation to the commissioner in april this year the presentation not only discloses the substance of the legal advice from blakes but also some of its detail and foundations in my opinion one consequence of this disclosure is that awb has waived privilege over any other legal advice that it obtained prior to 25 may 2004 in relation to the same subject matters or the same issues as blakes addressed in its presentation awb contends that lindbergs evidence to the commission on 17 january 2006 did not disclose the gist or conclusion of any legal advice i disagree in my opinion it disclosed the gist or substance of legal advice that awb had previously obtained as to whether awb had engaged in conduct in breach of the united nations sanctions and whether awb had paid inland transportation fees to alia as a conduit for the payment of money to the iraqi regime in the course of his evidence lindberg went out of his way to assert that the legal review that cooper had instituted assisted by external legal advisers had reported periodically and did not find any evidence to substantiate the allegations that awb had made payments in breach of the sanctions in one instance at least lindbergs assertions to this effect were not directly responsive to the question asked of him by counsel assisting the commission lindberg gave these answers in the presence of counsel for awb without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege i am satisfied that by means of this evidence awb voluntarily deployed the legal advice that it had obtained prior to 17 january 2006 i infer that it did so because it considered it was in its interests for it to be publicly known that awb had conducted an extensive legal review which had found no evidence of any wrongdoing in his evidence lindberg specifically referred to a series of periodical reports from those undertaking the legal review there were a number of reports and the findings of those reports are recorded in the minutes and the basis of those findings has been communicated in letters that have been sent to the government and elsewhere i find that in his evidence to the commission lindberg was referring to the combined effect of all of the legal advice that awb received during the course of the internal review as periodical reports were made to the boards of awb and awbi it follows in my view that lindbergs evidence has the consequence that awb has waived privilege over any legal advice that it obtained in the course of the review that goes to the same subject matters or relates to the same issues as the legal advice that lindberg described in the course of his evidence in relation to mr tracey qcs advices awb produced his written advices of 8 june 2004 31 march 2005 and 12 august 2005 to the commission early in april 2006 in my view the consequence of this production is that awb must be taken to have waived legal professional privilege in any other legal advices that it obtained prior to mr tracey qcs last advice of 12 august 2005 in relation to the same subjects or issues as already mentioned i also consider that quite separately awb has waived privilege over the advice it obtained from mr tracey qc on 22 september 2005 in relation to resolution 661 as a result of the project water investigations the directors of awb obtained legal advice from cooper at the board meeting on 14 december 2004 that the tigris transaction complied with all necessary laws and involved no breaches of law a handwritten note of that advice has been produced to the commission awb was entitled to claim that this note was protected from production to the commission by legal professional privilege it did not claim privilege i infer that it did not do so because it wanted it to be known publicly that awb had advice as of 14 december 2004 to the effect that the tigris transaction complied with all necessary laws and involved no breaches by awb having disclosed the gist or substance of its legal advice in this manner it would be inconsistent to allow awb to maintain confidentiality and privilege in any other legal advices that awb obtained prior to 14 december 2004 dealing with the same subject matter or the same issues the advice that cooper gave to awbs board on 14 december 2004 related specifically to the tigris transaction however i consider that the other disclosures that i have already discussed were expressed in such broad terms that they encompassed any advices concerning the tigris transaction andor the iron filings claim as a result i consider that there has been a waiver of other advices about the tigris transaction such as mr tracey qcs memorandum of 26 october 2004 document 353a the cumulative effect of awbs disclosures is that down to 17 january 2006 when lindberg gave evidence to the commission awb was openly claiming that its legal advice showed that there was no evidence that it had engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with its supply of wheat to iraq under the off programme including wrongdoing of the kind described at 180 above i find that awb made these claims to advance its commercial interests awbs conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in any advices dealing with the same subjects or issues in addition lindberg cooper and scales gave evidence to the commission that awb obtained legal advice that the proceeds of the inflated prices in contracts a1670 and a1680 should be disbursed to tigris to the extent of approximately us7 million that evidence was given in the presence of awbs legal representatives without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege again i infer that awb was content for it to be publicly known that it had obtained that legal advice having disclosed the gist or substance of that advice awb is bound to disclose any other legal advices it obtained in relation to the same subject or same issue awbs revised list of privileged documents contains several advices relating to the tigris payment they include documents 337 and 385 documents 1088 1089 1092 1093 and 1094 record the substance of those advices in minutes of meetings held by the awb and awbi boards in december 2004 and february 2005 and the chairmans running sheets for the february 2005 meetings the evidence which lindberg cooper and scales gave in public before the commission is inconsistent with awbs attempt to maintain privilege in these documents one question which remains to be dealt with is whether the scope of the waiver that must in my view be imputed to awb is to be confined to any other legal advice that awb obtained prior to the date of the relevant disclosures that addressed the same subject matters or issues as the advice that awb voluntarily disclosed in my opinion the waiver is not so confined it extends to the documents and information which were taken into account in formulating or which otherwise underpinned or influenced the legal advice that awb has chosen to disclose the commonwealth argued that awbs disclosures are broad enough to encompass any legal advice which awb obtained and any documents which awbs lawyers reviewed or created in the course of the project rose and project water investigations the difficulty with this way of approaching the boundaries of the waiver of associated material is that the terms project rose and project water have an indefinite and imprecise ambit according to the authorities discussed above the limits of any waiver of associated material depend upon the nature of the advice that has been disclosed what was represented by means of the disclosure and the character of the transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice regard must also be had to the way in which awbs legal advice was described in the various disclosures essentially by means of the disclosures awb was asserting that a detailed legal review had been undertaken and that it had concluded that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing or other improper conduct by awb in connection with its sale of wheat to iraq under the off programme in my opinion the nature and character of this disclosure is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in those documents which were taken into account by awbs legal advisers in arriving at the advice they gave to adapt the language used by mcclellan cj at common law in thomas at 17 and 20 awbs disclosures of its legal advice effect a waiver of privilege in the documents which were reviewed for the purposes of that advice or which influenced its content furthermore awb emphasised the breadth of its internal review in its various disclosures in my view awb thereby waived privilege in documents which define the scope of the review or which reveal what investigations were in fact undertaken in the course of the review much the same answer follows if one asks what was the legal exercise or transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice see factortame at 598599 and fulham at 604 11 and 607 18 having regard to the form of the legal advice disclosed by awb the relevant legal exercise or transaction encompassed a review of original documents and witness interviews as well as summaries chronologies or other analytical documents prepared by the lawyers with a view to determining whether there was any improper or wrongful conduct by awb material of this kind underpinned or influenced the legal advice which awb has chosen to disclose and it is not severable from that advice there is a certain symmetry in defining the boundaries of the waiver of associated material in this way documents brought into existence in the course of a lawyers factual investigation are prima facie capable of attracting legal professional privilege where the investigation is being undertaken for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice if the client voluntarily discloses the gist or substance of the legal advice that is founded upon such investigations the rationale for according privilege to the investigative material will have disappeared while i would go further the approach that i have described is not unlike the approach that awb has already taken in connection with the production to the commission of mr tracey qcs memoranda of advice and instructions in the case of mr tracey qcs oral advice of 25 may 2004 and his confirmatory memorandum of 12 august 2005 awb determined correctly in my view that the underlying documents supplied to mr tracey qc must also be produced awb considered that the form of mr tracey qcs advice ie there was no evidence of wrongdoing meant that it was impossible to separate his legal advice from the copy documents that were supplied to him as part of his instructions the evidence before me does not reveal whether awb adopted the same approach to mr tracey qcs advice of 31 march 2005 when he was asked to provide this advice copy documents were supplied to mr tracey qc as part of his instructions but there is no evidence one way or the other as to whether those copy documents have been produced to the commission the substance of mr tracey qcs advice was that nothing in the documents supplied to him as of 31 march 2005 had caused him to vary his earlier advice of 25 may 2004 this advice cannot be separated from the documents that were supplied to him and accordingly awbs express waiver of privilege in his advice extends to all of the documents and instructions supplied to him the applicable principle can also be illustrated by reference to the advice that blakes gave in its presentation of 25 may 2004 the advice that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by awb that involved a breach of the united nations sanctions was explicitly founded upon a review of a large number of documents and interviews of awb personnel having regard to the form of its advice it is impossible to separate blakes advice from the underlying documentation and interviews however the witness interviews and other materials that blakes relied upon to formulate its advice have not been produced to the commission and are still the subject of claims for legal professional privilege in my opinion those claims of privilege are not maintainable privilege has been waived by inter alia the production of blakes advice the same approach must be adopted to any advices that blakes provided after 25 may 2004 on the question whether any evidence had emerged of any wrongdoing or improper conduct on the part of awb another question which remains to be dealt with is the extent of any waiver that arises from awbs production to the commission of the instructions to sir anthony mason in its particulars setting forth its objections to awbs privilege claims the commonwealth contended that these disclosures had brought about a waiver of legal professional privilege in relation to project rose it tendered the instructions which abl provided to sir anthony mason on 16 september and 20 october 2005 and the expert opinion which sir anthony mason provided dated 24 october 2005 however the commonwealth did not direct any submissions to this aspect of its waiver case either orally or in its written submissions nor did awb address any oral or written submissions to the consequences which flowed from its production to the commission of the instructions to and the advice obtained from sir anthony mason it must be borne in mind that awb is seeking a declaration that all of the documents set forth in its revised list of privileged documents are the subject of legal professional privilege these documents include documents by which awb obtained legal advice both in australia and in the united states concerning the applicability of resolution 661 the instructions to sir anthony mason summarised the gist or substance of the very same legal advice in these circumstances i have concluded that the court must take account of the evidence that has been placed before it by disclosing the instructions given to sir anthony mason awb has in my opinion disclosed the substance of legal advice it had obtained as at 20 october 2005 both in australia and in the united states as to the applicability of resolution 661 this disclosure encompasses mr tracey qcs memorandum of 22 september 2005 and professor wippmans advice of 27 september 2005 thus far i have identified the principles which define the boundaries of the waiver that is to be imputed to awb including the boundaries of any waiver of associated material the remaining task in disposing of the waiver arguments is to determine precisely what documents fall within these boundaries i have carried out that task by inspecting the documents over which claims of privilege have been made reviewing the evidence concerning each document and applying the principles identified above as a result i have determined that awb has waived any legal professional privilege that would otherwise attach to the documents as listed under the heading conclusions below the iron filings claim communications between a lawyer and client which facilitate a crime or fraud are not protected by legal professional privilege this principle is often referred to as the fraud exception to legal professional privilege but this does not capture its full reach attorneygeneral nt v kearney 1985 hca 60 1985 158 clr 500 kearney at 515

principle to deny legal professional privilege to legal advice obtained by the northern territory government which was prima facie a deliberate abuse of statutory power to defeat a land claim under the aboriginal land rights northern territory act 1976 cth in his reasons for judgment gibbs cj with whom mason and brennan jj agreed stated at 515 that legal professional privilege will be denied to a communication which is made for the purpose of frustrating the processes of the law itself even though no crime or fraud is contemplated some authorities have expressed the principle as applicable to prevent a fraud on justice in a broad sense the concept of a fraud on justice was adopted by lander j in gartner v carter 2004 fca 258 gartner v carter to deny protection to a communication between a lawyer and client for the purpose of the client putting assets beyond the reach of the legitimate claims of secured creditors at 130 and 139140 the principle extends to trickery and shams a sham

v mercorella no 3 2006 fca 772 provides an example of the denial of legal professional privilege to documents in furtherance of a sham transaction in that case creditors of a managed investment scheme claimed privilege over documents relating to securities obtained from the defendant and certain companies in the scheme the transactions were allegedly entered into so as to advance those creditors interests over the interests of other creditors to the scheme mansfield j found that the communications were prima facie in furtherance of a sham and as such were not privileged after referring to lander js decision in gartner v carter and barclays bank plc v eustice 1995 4 all er 511 barclays bank his honour stated at 95 it is a short step from those decisions to the present facts as prima facie found the creditors engaged in the transactions reflected in the deed and the granting of the securities within the structures it created to secure or advance their interests over others who had advanced money to the first defendant or to the scheme there is a prima facie case that the restructure of the advances so that they appear as advances to the partnership of ajay and opey is a sham mansfield j drew a distinction at 96100 between communications to obtain advice in relation to what if anything could lawfully be done to improve the prospects of being repaid or of obtaining the interest to which the client was entitled which were privileged and communications which have the effect of concealing the true nature of a transaction and which enable a client to present a picture which is not true which were not privileged where a client is engaged in fraudulent conduct communications with his or her lawyer in furtherance of the fraud are not privileged regardless of whether the lawyer is a party to the fraud or not clements at 562 213 the principle applies to communications passing between a client and lawyer where the lawyer is innocent of the fraud or improper purpose

715 r v central criminal court ex parte francis amp francis 1989 ac 346 cited with approval in clements at 562565 217218 it is important to bear in mind that the fraud exception is based on public policy grounds the principle is sufficiently flexible to capture a range of situations where the protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client would be contrary to the public interest see kearney at 514515 r v cox at 614 this aspect of the principle is reflected in the statement that the privilege takes flight if the relationship between lawyer and client is abused clark v united states 1933 289 us 1 at 15 see also kearney at 514 and 524 in barclays bank communications between the client and his lawyer in relation to the setting up of transactions at an undervalue so as to prejudice the bank were held to be sufficiently iniquitous for public policy to require those communications to be discoverable schiemann lj with whom aldous and butlersloss ljj agreed stated at 524 if that view be correct then it matters not whether either the client or the solicitor shared that view they may well have thought that the transactions would not fall to be set aside either because they thought that the transactions were not at an undervalue or because they thought that the court would not find that the purpose of the transactions was to prejudice the bank but if this is what they thought then there is a strong prima facie case that they were wrong public policy does not require the communications of those who misapprehend the law to be privileged in circumstances where no privilege attaches to those who correctly understand the situation for the principle to apply there must be more than a mere assertion or allegation of fraud or impropriety bullivant at 201 203 and 204205 in propend at 514 brennan cj expressed the test as being one of reasonable grounds for believing that the relevant communication was for an improper purpose the requirement has also been described as one of a prima facie case butler v board of trade 1971 1 ch 680 butler at 689 cf baker v evans 1987 77 alr 565 at 574 in kearney at 516 gibbs cj approved the test formulated in orourke v darbishire 1920 ac 581 at 604 namely that there must be something to give colour to the charge the statement must be made in clear and definite terms and there must further be some prima facie evidence that it has some foundation in fact the high court in propend applied this test at 514 per brennan cj at 521 per dawson j 534 per toohey j 546 per gaudron j 556 per mchugh j and 592 per kirby j it is not necessary to prove an improper purpose on the balance of probabilities the prima facie test arguably reflects the fact that issues of legal professional privilege are usually dealt with in the interlocutory stages of a proceeding but the authorities have not departed from that formulation where a declaration is sought in relation to privilege issues butler propend beazley it must also be established on the same prima facie basis that the communication which is the subject of the claim for privilege was made in furtherance of or as a step preparatory to the commission of the fraud or wrongdoing in butler goff j found at 687 that a letter written by the plaintiffs lawyer which volunteered a warning that the plaintiff may incur serious consequences if he did not take care was not shown to be in preparation for or in furtherance of or as part of any criminal designs on the part of the plaintiff see also zemanek v commonwealth bank of australia unreported federal court hill j 2 october 1997 in propend the high court considered whether a charge of improper purpose must be based on evidence that is admissible in the proceeding the only evidence of alleged illegality before the trial judge in propend was the sworn information which supported the issue of a search warrant for the relevant documents the court held that while the sworn information was admissible to establish the basis upon which the warrant was issued it was not admissible to show that the copy documents were not privileged see at 514 per brennan cj 557 per mchugh j 576 per gummow j 547 per gaudron j and 593 per kirby j the iron filings claim refers to a claim by gbi for a rebate of us201613300 on account of the fact that earlier shipments of wheat by awb to gbi had been contaminated by iron filings lindberg agreed to pay this sum to gbi in settlement of the iron filings claim in about october 2002 during the course of a visit to bagdad an email dated 7 november 2002 from chris whitwell of awb whitwell to lindberg and others reporting on the trip to iraq in october 2002 stated that the responsible iraqi minister had asked for repayment of the iron filings rebate through the inland transport mechanism the same email referred to the fact that the iraqi minister was seeking cabinet approval for repayment of the tigris debt at the outset of this case the commonwealth contended that any legal advice that awb obtained in connection with the tigris transaction was waived by virtue of awbs production to the commission of a partly masked memorandum of 7 february 2003 dealing with the subject of the iron filings payment and tigris petroleum fee on the first day of the hearing awb announced that it was no longer seeking a declaration of privilege in respect of documents connected with the tigris transaction which the commonwealth sought to challenge on the basis of the fraud exception subsequently awb made it clear that this concession did not extend to six documents relating to the iron filings rebate payment during the course of the hearing in this court awb produced an unmasked copy of the memorandum of 7 february 2003 and provided it to the commonwealth the commonwealth tendered the memorandum as an exhibit in this proceeding without any objection from awb the memorandum contains a fairly full description of the way in which awb planned to pay the iron filings claim to gbi the memorandum which was sent by whitwell to messrs geary and long with copies to scales johnson hogan johnstone cooper lyons hockey and thomas states private and confidential this memo is in respect to refunding the grain board of iraq the quality rebate of approx usd 2016133 through the inland transport payments for the new contract as requested by the minister of trade iraq in addition for the record is amp m has negotiated through an uplift in price the recovery of a usd 8375 million outstanding debt to tigris by igb through this contract awb will repay this debt back to tigris less an agreed recovery fee of usd 500 k on a pro rata basis as tonnage is shipped overview delegation led by andrew lindberg august 2002 to baghdad agreed to settle the contamination of the iron filings vessels by paying them usd 6 pmt for each vessel total usd 2016133 after being approached by tigris petroleum awb and igb have agreed to allow the new contract to be the conduit for a repayment of usd 8375000 owed to tigris by igb for a cargo of wheat shipped in 1996 igb have agreed to raising the contract price by the debt amount and when payments are made under the letter of credit awb will pay tigris its debt less awbs recovery fee we have suggested the following during our last two visits 8226 offsetting the debt against the outstanding debt to tigris petroleum approx usd 835 million 8226 reducing the any new contract price sic by the amount of the rebate on a pmt basis 8226 repaying the debt through the provision of aid in some form wheat health supplies etc however in discussion with the minister of trade he has continually insisted on repayment directly as an addition to the inland transport and said that this was his understanding of the agreement with andrew lindberg michael long was present and confirms that this was discussed now that the new contract has been concluded ism need a sign off to organise this payment when shipments start issues 8226 possible implications for awb on a corporate governance basis ie direct payment to a company with links to the iraqi regime may be construed to be in contravention of the un sanctions the relevant un security council resolution is 661 1990 this resolution provides at clause 4 all states shall not make available to the government of iraq or to any commercial industrial or public utility undertaking in iraq any funds or any other financial or economic resources and shall prevent their nationals and any persons within their territories from removing from their territories or otherwise making available to that government or to any such undertaking any such funds or resources and from remitting any other funds to persons or bodies within iraq except payments exclusively for strictly medical or humanitarian purposes and in humanitarian circumstances foodstuffs in summary this means that the government of the commonwealth of australia would be obliged to prevent awb limited from making any remittance of funds to the igb awb legal opinion in this regard is set out below this does not mean however that a payment might not be able to be made which will comply with the terms of the un resolutions as a minimum if awb management determines to make the payment then it should be made in the following circumstances 1 the payment is made in installments over time and coincides with payments for future shipments of wheat ie not a lump sum payment 2 the payments preferably be made to a company other than the igb and in a jurisdiction other than iraq and 3 the payments be recorded as being made as a part of a settlement reached between awb and igb the terms of which contemplated that igb would agree not to take any action against awb for the alleged contamination of the 8 vessels in 2002 with iron filings and would agree to enter into contracts for the purchase of australian bulk wheat in the future in exchange for a renegotiation of the price on the 8 vessels if we ensure that the above requirements are met then legal consider it will be at least arguable that we are not making funds or financial resources available to the iraqi government instead we are repaying part of the contract price for the 8 vessels following a renegotiation of the sale price due to a downgrading of the grain which potentially contained iron filings in addition to the above the un security council resolutions also require resolution 986 1995 clause 8 that the cost of food exports to iraq must be met by draw down from the un escrow account furthermore draw down from the escrow account is only allowable under strict conditions those conditions include at clause 8aiii that the goods to which payment is referable shall have arrived in iraq in this case the goods have already arrived in iraq and have been paid for in full however the resolutions are silent on the procedure for any repayment of part of the price in circumstances where there has been a quality complaint and a subsequent renegotiation of price this may therefore give us more scope to make the repayment to igb even if we make payment as outlined above there is still a risk that the australian government andor the united nations will take a contrary view on the interpretation of the above mentioned resolutions and declare that awb has breached the terms of those resolutions by making the payment this is a commercial and political issue which awbs management will need to consider 8226 according to an informal discussion with dfat any repayment of a quality rebate should be either repayed through un escrow account or as a contract price reduction however they have not had a full legal argument put in front of them or been told officially in public affairs opinion as long as the repayment is legal and could not be seen to be breaking un sanctions then we should proceed with the proviso that we have an independent legal opinion to that effect see above legal opinion public affairs also expressed concern that this would not be well received by the un oip office and that there was a reasonable chance of them finding out is amp m on the other hand do not want them involved and feel confident that this issue could be handled without the need for the oip to be consulted it has been articulated to us and we have circumstantial evidence that other participants in the oip program russian and pakistani companies have had to sort out quality problems in a similar way and it is unlikely either their national governments or the oip were consulted 8226 is amp m feel strongly that a failure to repay the igb as discussed will lead to serious consequences for awbs relationship with the igb is amp m also believe that failure to refund this agreed debt in this way would have serious implications for the execution of the new contracts awbi are aware of all the issues laid out above and in light of the commercial imperative of this situation agree with the recommendation as laid out below they do however insist that the managing director is appraised of the situation actions whilst is amp m have received a number of different opinions from different areas of awb and an informal opinion from dfat we still feel this issue is a grey area with no prescriptive answers based on the opinions we do have and the commercial circumstances surrounding this issue is amp m recommend and seek approval for the following 8226 is amp m is to repay debt as per method outlined in awbs legal opinion and requested by the minister of trade directly to alia transport in jordan in instalments is amp m will also look to obtain written agreement from igb to the payment in the format agreed by legal however it is not guaranteed 8226 managing director only to convey our intentions to the australian government at the appropriate time prior to shipment the timing of such a disclosure is important and we would recommend that nothing be done until at least letters of credit are in place for these contracts given that this is unlikely to happen until after a war with iraq it may allow us a further chance of renegotiation with a new regime 8226 is amp m to finalise as soon as possible a written agreement with tigris with regard to the settlement of their debt original emphasis omitted the evidence before me establishes to the requisite prima facie standard that the price in contracts a1670 and a1680 was inflated to cover both the amount of the iron filings claim and the repayment by gbi of the debt which it owed to tigris a surcharge of us8375 pmt was added to each contract in respect of the tigris debt as shown by an email from nigel edmondswilson to scales and others at awb dated 12 december 2002 the same email shows that in each contract the inland transportation fee was set at us5115 pmt at the commission mr geary of awb gave evidence that the prices in these two contracts were inflated to cover a component for the tigris debt and a component for the us2 million iron filings rebate he also said that the united nations was not advised at any stage that the prices for wheat in these two contracts had been inflated in this way so as to cover the tigris debt and the iron filings claim to adopt the words of viscount finlay in orourke the evidence gives ample colour to the charge that the prices in these two contracts were falsely misrepresented the evidence shows that the prices in the two wheat contracts were inflated as a means of extracting money from the united nations escrow account having regard to the terms of the memorandum of 7 february 2003 there are reasonable grounds for believing that having extracted approximately us2 million from the escrow account to meet the iron filings claim awb planned to pay that money in instalments to gbi via the mechanism of inland transportation fees the material before me including whitwells email of 7 november 2002 and his memorandum of 7 february 2003 indicates clearly that awb knew that paying inland transportation fees to alia was a means of making payments to the iraqi government this plan was concealed from the united nations the planned payments of the iron filings claim were never carried into effect because the invasion of iraq intervened scales gave evidence to the commission that the iron filings money has never been paid and remains in awbis accounts however the fact that the payments were never made to the gbi will not prevent the application of the fraud exception so long as there is sufficient evidence that the communications were in furtherance of or preparatory to the commission of the fraud or impropriety in the broad sense described above see butler and clements at 562 213 in my view the evidence establishes a more than adequate prima facie case that awb knowingly and deliberately disguised the true nature of the prices in contracts a1670 and a1680 if it be relevant i also consider that the evidence establishes the foregoing matters on the balance of probabilities and to a level of satisfaction commensurate with the seriousness of the allegation see briginshaw v briginshaw 1938 hca 34 1938 60 clr 336 at 362 per dixon j no question arises here of evidence which would not be admissible in a final hearing cf propend awb argued that there was no evidence that the transaction furthered any particular fraud iniquity or illegality it submitted that it is common ground that the united nations resolutions were not in terms incorporated into australian law awb submitted that consequently the fraud exception is not available to take the documents out of the operation of the doctrine of legal professional privilege this narrow approach is at odds with the authorities that stress the wide range of fraudulent or iniquitous activities that fall within the principle i have inspected the six documents that were said to relate to the iron filings claim my inspection of awbs documents revealed a further four documents that fall within this category and are still the subject of a privilege claim i am satisfied that these 10 documents are not privileged the documents were prima facie brought into existence in furtherance of an improper and dishonest purpose viz inflating the prices of contracts a1670 and a1680 so as to extract payments out of the united nations escrow account that would then be utilised in part to satisfy a compensation claim by gbi prima facie the evidence establishes that the transaction was deliberately and dishonestly structured by awb so as to misrepresent the true nature and purpose of the trucking fees and to work a trickery on the united nations it would be contrary to public policy for the privilege to enure in communications of this kind the 10 documents in question are listed below in my conclusions there is an alternative basis for rejecting awbs claim for privilege over the 10 iron filings documents awbs disclosure of the memorandum of 7 february 2003 and its tender by the commonwealth as an exhibit in these proceedings without any objection or claim to confidentiality by awb effects a waiver over the subject matter of the legal advice set out in the memorandum my inspection of the 10 documents relating to the iron filings claim confirms my view that those documents relate to the subjects and issues that are canvassed in the memorandum of 7 february 2003 if contrary to my view any privilege subsisted in any of the documents it has been waived by awb when the commonwealth tendered the unmasked version of the memorandum of 7 february 2003 i asked mr judd why awbs production of that document did not waive any privilege that subsisted in documents relating to the iron filings claim mr judds response was that the commonwealth did not put its case on that basis i do not think that is entirely correct in the particulars of its case the commonwealth contended that awbs disclosure of the masked version of the memorandum of 7 february 2003 worked a waiver of any privilege in documents relating to project water and the tigris transaction the commonwealth has never varied from the position that the iron filings claim was an integral part of the tigris transaction however the commonwealth did not in its closing address make any submission that privilege over the six documents had been waived by the production of the unmasked memorandum to that extent mr judds response was correct despite these matters i have concluded that the court cannot ignore the effect of the evidence before it especially as awb is seeking a declaration that the 10 documents are privileged conclusions it is not feasible in these reasons for judgment when so many documents are at issue to set out separate reasons for the decision i have reached on each particular document i have reached the conclusions set forth hereunder after inspecting all of the documents in awbs revised list of privileged documents and by applying the legal principles and factual findings identified above awb has not made out its claim for privilege in respect of the following documents 229 245247 279 280 362b 469a 495 542 565 586 675 784 867 872 890an 1090 1091 1095 1096 1098 1099 1118 and 1262 these documents fall into the following categories a documents for which there is no evidence of purpose to satisfy the dominant purpose test documents 229 469a 542 and 565 b documents where the evidence does not satisfy the dominant purpose test having regard to the nature and content of the document and the vague and formulaic evidence contained in the relevant segments of the affidavit evidence documents 279 280 495 675 784 867 872 890an 1095 1096 1098 1099 1118 and 1262 c a document that was provided to a third party and therefore was not a confidential communication for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice document 362b d documents which are partly not proven and partly waived documents 245247 586 1090 1091 which are discussed further below if contrary to my view privilege does attach to any of these documents there has been a waiver of privilege in respect of all of them other than documents 362b 784 872 and 1118 the waived documents are included in the list at 237 below in addition there are 10 documents relating to the iron filings claims they are as follows 30 31 32 32a 33 41 594 595 595a and 596 privilege does not attach to these documents as they were brought into existence in furtherance of a fraud or other impropriety alternatively any privilege has been waived by awb these documents are included in the list at 237 below awb has waived any legal professional privilege that subsisted in the following documents 12 30133 41 56 7779

1262 and 1297 in broad terms the documents over which privilege has been waived comprise documents falling within the following categories documents which define the scope of awbs internal review or which identify what investigations were carried out summaries chronologies and other documents which record or analyse the results of those investigations witness statements and other notes or records of interviews of awb personnel records of meetings and periodical reports concerning the findings of the review and documents seeking advice or comprising or recording advice provided to awb as to whether awb or any of its employees engaged in wrongdoing in connection with wheat sales to iraq under the off programme including any wrongdoing in connection with the tigris transaction as i have explained waiver does not turn on whether the documents attracted the description project rose or project water on inspection i determined that numerous documents marked re project rose or the equivalent fall outside the scope of any waiver as they related to distinct matters about which awb sought or obtained legal advice such as the powers and jurisdiction of the psi and iic investigators other us legal issues the memorandum of understanding between the iic and awb representation of awb employees at iic hearings the powers of the wheat export authority and issues of directors and officers insurance and corporate governance there are a number of documents where on inspection i have determined that the document is only capable of attracting privilege as to part the balance of the claim for privilege not having been proved but that such privilege has been waived these documents require some further explanation a documents 245 and 246 are drafts of an information paper dated 13 august 2004 document 247 substantially replicates the draft information paper in a power point presentation format awb claims privilege in two parts of each of these documents as indicated on the face of the documents in substance awb contended that these parts attracted privilege because they recorded legal advice on inspection i concluded that the claim is not established in respect of the first part of the documents i have determined that the second part claimed attracts privilege but awb has waived privilege in respect of that second part b document 586 is a table of various legal advices in the possession of blakes awb contended that the table recorded legal advice on inspection i concluded that this claim is not sustainable save for the entries listed at 23 24 and 25 of the table which disclose the substance of legal advice given by mr tracey qc i have determined that awb has waived privilege in respect of entries 23 24 and 25 of the table c documents 1090 and 1091 are respectively the minutes of awb and awbi board meetings dated 22 february 2005 awb claims privilege in two parts of each of these documents as indicated on the face of the documents it contended that these parts recorded legal advice as to the first part claimed this is not borne out by my inspection i have determined that the second part claimed attracts privilege but awb has waived privilege in respect of that second part there are also a number of documents which i have determined to be privileged only as to part of the claim made by awb after inspecting the documents and applying the principles i have discussed i have determined that certain parts of the documents are privileged while privilege in another part or parts of the documents has not been proved or it has been waived it is necessary to deal with each of these documents a document 138 contains three pages of handwritten file notes privilege has not been established in respect of the first page of the document if contrary to my view privilege is attracted it has been waived privilege is established in respect of the second page of the document privilege has not been established in respect of the third page of the document or if privilege is attracted contrary to my view it has been waived b document 251 is a document consisting of a number of entries in a spreadsheet awb claims privilege in certain parts of the document as indicated on the face of the document awb has waived privilege in respect of the parts claimed on pages 367 368 380 390 and the first of the two parts claimed on each of pages 388 and 395 the page numbering refers to the system that awb has adopted for its document control purposes otherwise the document attracts privilege to the extent claimed c document 376 is a handwritten file note headed iraq report for jis i have determined that the document attracts privilege but that awb has waived privilege in respect of the part of the document that relates to the tigris transaction namely the second entry commencing with the words completion of iraq mkt access arrangements and concluding with the words confirm there is compliance d documents 503 520 522 526 527 and 965 contain various drafts of a briefing paper initially prepared by abl i have determined that each of the documents attracts privilege but that awb has waived privilege in respect of the part of each document under the headings legal review and key messages e document 516 is another draft of the briefing paper referred to in the preceding subparagraph i have determined that the document attracts privilege but that awb has waived privilege in respect of the part of the document under the heading legal review f document 691 is a record of a meeting attended by various internal awb employees and external lawyers awb said that the document attracted privilege in part dr fuller gave evidence that it recorded legal advice of leonie thompson i have determined that the passage on page 028 of the document opposite the entry leonie t is privileged as to the remainder of the document it does not record any legal advice and is not privileged g document 696 is a record of a meeting attended by various internal awb employees and external lawyers awb claimed that the document was part privileged and relied on dr fullers evidence that it recorded legal advice given by leon zwier i have determined that the passage on page 037 of the document opposite the heading leon zwier to the balance of the page is privileged privilege has not been established in respect of the remainder of the document if any privilege attached to the remainder it has been waived h document 704s is a record of various matters discussed between awbs external and internal lawyers i have determined that awb has waived privilege over the six lines commencing with the entry which includes the words iron filings case the balance of the document is privileged i document 704ii is a handwritten record of various conversations on 20 and 28 september 2004 on the face of the document it appears that a claim for privilege is made only over the part of the document which is dated 28 september 2004 privilege has been established over the entry dated 28 september 2004 however the evidence of ms peavey in relation to document 704ii addresses the entry of 20 september 2004 if privilege is claimed over the part of the document which is dated 20 september 2004 it has not been established j document 1097 is the minutes of a meeting of the awb and awbi joint board committee there are two parts of the document over which a claim for privilege is made on the ground that they record legal advice on inspection i determined that the part of the document consisting of the first bullet point under the heading project rose is privileged however privilege has not been established over the third bullet point if privilege is attracted over that part of the document it has been waived document 1297 is a redacted copy of an email from cooper to lindberg and scales copied to quennell dated 16 november 2004 it appears that the redactions mask those parts of the document over which a claim for privilege is made prima facie the document appears to be within the scope of the waiver i have identified and applied in these reasons for judgment however i propose to invite further submissions from the parties as to whether document 1297 is in contest and if so i will direct that an unredacted version of the document be filed with the court for its inspection as for the remaining documents awb has in some instances claimed privilege over the entire document and in other instances it has only claimed privilege over a designated part or parts of the document awb has established that legal professional privilege attaches to the following documents to the extent claimed by it 20 21 55 8998 107 108 119 133 135 143146 150152 154160 162190 194 196 197 199201 204211a 215 217222 224228 230234

documents in this list are or record confidential communications that are protected from production to the commissioner by legal professional privilege at the hearing neither awb nor the commonwealth directed any substantive submissions to the status of these duplicate documents in its written submissions awb referred to the principles enunciated in propend as to the circumstances in which a copy of an unprivileged document can itself attract legal professional privilege in those written submissions awb contended that the qualification which brennan cj expressed in propend at 512 does not represent the law the chief justices qualification was that if the original unprivileged document is not in existence or its location is not disclosed or it is not produced and if no unprivileged copy or other admissible evidence is available to prove the contents of the original document then privilege cannot be maintained over the copy however awb did not make any submissions as to how or why this qualification might be relevant to its claims awb adopted the position that the status of the duplicate documents depends on my decision as to the status of the corresponding original document the commonwealth did not make any submission to the contrary at the hearing although its written submissions contended that awb had failed to identify the purpose for which particular duplicates were created or to establish that they were kept confidential it would seem a harsh result if awb were to lose the benefit of privilege in original documents simply because it has not explained or is unable to explain the circumstances in which copies were made in large organisations and within law firms it is hardly unexpected that multiple copies of privileged documents will be brought into existence and that long after the event it may be difficult to adduce evidence as to the circumstances in which the copies were made the submissions of the parties were so cursory that i did not gain any meaningful assistance from them however i have reached the following conclusions where i have held that specified original documents do not attract legal professional privilege no case has been made out that duplicates of those documents are entitled to privilege where i have held that specified original documents attract legal professional privilege i have concluded that privilege attaches to the duplicates the duplicates come from the custody of awb and there is nothing to suggest that the duplicates were dealt with or communicated in ways that would deny the privilege claim furthermore the material before me does not identify any specific grounds for concluding that the duplicates do not attract privilege a number of documents in awbs revised list of privileged documents are said to be duplicates of other documents in the list there is no evidence as to some of those documents documents 291 307 and 580 and others have been removed documents 26 and 1031 consequently i have not made any findings about those documents it is unclear whether they remain in contest it is necessary to make specific reference to a number of other duplicate documents in the list a document 582 is a copy of document 140 i have determined that awb has waived any privilege attaching to the documents b document 998 is a copy of document 995 and document 1001 is a copy of part of document 1000 i have determined that the originals are privileged for the reasons given at 247 above privilege attaches to the copy documents c document 1006 is said by chesterman to be a copy of document 1005 my inspection of the documents has revealed that this is not the case there is therefore no evidence capable of supporting the claim for privilege in respect of document 1006 however even if there were evidence that document 1006 attracted privilege i am satisfied that awb has waived the privilege relief i have determined that specified documents are not the subject of legal professional privilege and that other documents attract legal professional privilege the court has power to make declarations to this effect i propose to give awb and the commonwealth an opportunity to make submissions as to the form of any declarations that should be made to give effect to these reasons for judgment awbs second further amended application also sought declarations relating to the construction and validity of the amending act in addition awb sought a declaration that the exercise of powers by the commissioner under s 6aa2 of the rca while these proceedings are pending before this court would constitute a contempt of court and injunctions restraining the commissioner from making a decision under s 6aa2 of the rca no live issues arise concerning these claims for relief see awb ltd v honourable terence rhoderic hudson cole no 2 2006 fca 913 neither awb nor the commonwealth put any submissions to me whether orally or in writing concerning these claims for relief it is unnecessary to address them further accordingly the only orders i propose to make at this stage are as follows 1 within 3 business days awb and the commonwealth file an agreed minute of orders that give effect to these reasons for judgment if awb and the commonwealth are unable to agree upon appropriate orders within 3 business days awb and the commonwealth shall each file and serve a minute of

9040,33,3,35,29,6252,these proceedings were commenced on 20 december 2005 as an application for a declaration that the applicant who had been removed from australia was entitled to an absorbed person visa pursuant to s 34 of the migration act 1958 cth the act the applicant also sought an order that the respondents arrange the return of the applicant to australia a declaration of wrongful imprisonment and damages since then a number of events have occurred which have altered the issues that need to be determined first the applicant has been returned to australia by the commonwealth secondly the high court has given judgment allowing an appeal against a judgment of a full court of this court the full courts judgment underpinned part of the case originally advanced by the applicant the parties agreed that judgment in this matter could be reserved until the high court gave its judgment the high court gave judgment minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs v nystrom 2006 hca 50 on 8 november 2006 the judgment of the high court had the effect of removing two of the grounds relied on by the applicant the high courts judgment is discussed shortly 2 the facts agreed upon by the parties were as follows the applicant was born in paris france on 4 december 1966 to parents who were then both citizens of yugoslavia in 1968 when the applicant was two years of age his parents migrated to australia with him and his siblings the applicant and his family members were granted permanent entry permits on their arrival into australia in 1983 the applicants parents became australian citizens the applicant was not included in his parents application for citizenship from 19 september 1984 to 4 november 1984 the applicant travelled with his father to that part of yugoslavia which up until very recently was known as serbia and montenegro and then returned to australia as the holder of an old visa of a kind known as a return endorsement 3 on 1 september 1994 the applicant became the holder of a transitional permanent visa by operation of reg 9 the migration reform transitional provisions regulations 1994 cth between 1979 and 2001 the applicant was convicted of a number of criminal offences on 15 october 2002 the then minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs made a decision pursuant to s 5012 of the act to cancel the applicants transitional permanent visa the applicant was removed from australia on 18 june 2004 4 before the decision of the high court in nystrom the principal ground relied on by the applicant was that he held an absorbed person visa by operation of s 34 of the act and that the failure of the minister to take into account that he held that visa gave rise to jurisdictional error one of the statutory criteria for that visa was that the applicant had not on or after 2 april 1984 left australia the minister contended this criterion had not been satisfied by the applicant having regard to his travel to yugoslavia in late 1984 submissions were directed to the meaning of left australia 5 another argument advanced by the applicant was that s 200 and not s 501 was the applicable source of the power on which the minister might have acted and that there was a direct repugnance between s 501 and ss 200 and 201 with the result that the first respondents decision was vitiated by jurisdictional error 6 it is not necessary to consider those arguments in light of the high courts decision which held that where a person held two visas the same visas the applicant contends he held in this matter each of which conferred the same substantive rights in cancelling one the minister was not bound to take into account the nature of the other because there was no consideration relevant to the applicants absorbed person visa which was not relevant to and considered when the minister cancelled his transitional permanent visa at 129 per heydon and crennan jj gummow and hayne jj held that nothing in the text of s 501 or s 501f provided any support for reading into s 5012 a requirement to consider the possible effect of s 501f on the visa holder at 41 even if the applicant held an absorbed person visa in addition to his transitional permanent visa s 501f3 operates to cancel the absorbed person visa 7 the other issues which nystrom resolved concerned whether there was repugnancy between ss 200 and 201 and s 501 of the act the issue was whether s 501 of the act as a general provision yielded to the more specific provisions in s 200 and s 201 governing the deportation of noncitizens who have committed criminal offences with the result that the minister had no power to cancel a visa under s 501 in circumstances governed by s 200 and s 201 8 the high court in nystrom rejected this proposition and held that at 61 per gummow and hayne jj the two powers do not deal with the same subjectmatter so as to attract the operation of the maxim expressum facit cessare tacitum and the reasoning which underpins anthony hordern and other decisions the scheme of the principal act does not treat as having the one identity deportation and cancellation of a visa this is so notwithstanding that by reason of other provisions of the principal act the exercise of both powers may well result in the same practical outcome and at 67 and 6970 the powers in s 5012 and s 200 have different provenances and persons in respect of whom a deportation order has been made have a different status and different rights under the principal act those differences cannot be ignored by an ellipsis which regards s 200 and s 501 as directed to the same practical outcome section 5012 and ss 200 and 201 have different consequences for the status of individuals in the context of the principal act where a deportation order is made the individual has the status of a lawful noncitizen who is subject to deportation if an order under s 5012 be made the status of the individual changes to that of unlawful noncitizen the principal act attaches significance to each status accordingly it is not open to characterise the powers as dealing with the same subjectmatter in the sense of the anthony hordern line of cases in the circumstances of this case the inapplicability of s 200 by reason of nonsatisfaction of s 201bi cannot deny the application of s 5012 by reference to s 5016a 9 the remaining grounds in this matter concern the procedures adopted by the minister in reaching the decision to cancel the applicants transitional permanent visa 10 the applicant submitted that direction 21 required the decisionmaker to consider certain international obligations found in the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr direction 21 was made under s 499 of the act which provides that the minister may give directions to a person or body about the performance of functions under the act or as to the exercise of powers under the act but such a direction must not be inconsistent with the act or the migration regulations 1994 cth a person or body receiving the direction must comply with the direction direction 21 concerns visa refusal and cancellation under section 501 of the migration act 1958

12377,10,14,273,176,48999,earlier on 25 august 2004 a complaint had been lodged with hreoc by the present applicant mr jeremy jones in his capacity as president of the said executive council of australian jewry contained within that letter of complaint was the following we write to lodge a formal complaint under the antiracialhatred provisions part iia of the racial discrimination act 1975 cth in respect of material published on the australian website the website the executive council of australian jewry the peak representative organisation of the australian jewish community complains that i the material on the website is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend insult humiliate and intimidate jewish australians and ii one of the reasons that the material has been published is the race or national or ethnic origin of jewish people including jewish australians the specific matters complained of are as follows 1 at under the heading lies and the first anniversary of the 911 conspiracy where the following words appear we have all seen how the holocaust hoax of sixmillion jews claimed to have been gassed and cremated by germany in world war i failed to deceive the mob in 1919 whereas monopolistic control of the media film and a more boldly pursued holocaust hoax of sixmillion jews claimed gassed and cremated by germany in world war ii has produced such powerful psychological and material results the entire world is enslaved to the beneficiaries of the lie and temples of equivocation affront the intelligence of humanity in major cities worldwide 2 at the following words appear the holocaust has become the greatest instrument of sympathy which any nation has ever been able to use to gain support for wars expansion and foreignaid this has made israel the worlds sixth strongest military power the gravest threat to all this wealth and influence is the growing doubt over the question of whether or not a real holocaust of 6 million jews actually took place 3 at the wastherehtm webpage the following words appear at the conclusion the main theme of jewish fundraising is the holocaust and has been for 38 years when they dont use the holocaust the money collection sharply drops off thus the more the press tv and hollywood promotes the holocaust the more money the united jewish appeal and other zionist funds can extract from gullible people jewish leaders have discovered that by repeating holocaust stories over and over again they can instil a guilt complex within all gentiles this effectively silences most critics of zionist political goals why doesnt the jewcontrolled press tv and film industry give massive media attention to real victims and to proven holocausts of gentiles in recent history in our submission the above material breaches the provisions of part iia of the racial discrimination act because it conveys the following imputations a there is serious doubt that the holocaust occurred b it is unlikely that there were homicidal gas chambers at auschwitz c jewish people who are offended by and challenge holocaust denial are of limited intelligence and d some jewish people for improper purposes including financial gain exaggerated the number of jews killed during world war ii and the circumstances in which they were killed in this respect we refer you to the case of toben v jones 2003 fcafc 137 in which the full court of the federal court upheld the decision of branson j at first instance that it is unlawful under part iia of the act to publish material that conveys inter alia the imputations particularised above in our submission the material complained of conveys further imputations that are also in breach of part iia of the act namely that a jews as a group are inherently malevolent towards other people b jews as a group are engaged in a global conspiracy to dominate other people and c the state of israel as the state of the jewish people is a product of that conspiracy we further submit that none of the material complained of falls within the exemptions contained in s 18d of the act you will be aware that this council has brought two cases of racial hatred before hreoc in the past one against olga scully and the other against fredrick toben both cases were ultimately heard and determined in favour of the council by the federal court of australia in both cases the court was satisfied that jews and jewish australians in particular constitute a race or a national or ethnic group for the purposes of the act in the toben case the court also found that the publication of material on the internet is an act that is done otherwise than in private for the purposes of s 18c of the act we are seeking to have the material complained of removed from the internet and an apology to australias jewish community being given publicly by the websites owners the reference in the above letter to jewish australians and australian jewish community may be observed the connection of the bbc and of mr grigorscott to the foregoing bible believers website will be further indicated in these reasons the grounds or particulars of the complaint were at least implicitly adopted by mr jones therein and subsequently pursued in the present proceeding 7 the foregoing decision on appeal in toben v jones 2003 fcafc 137 2003 129 fcr 515 was made on 27 june 2003 by a full federal court comprising carr kiefel and allsop jj in favour of mr jones as complainant also in those proceedings in line with the decision at first instance of branson j in jones v toben 2002 71 ald 629 mr jones being the applicant for relief there involved is the same representative person for the executive council of australian jewry as here constituted 8 the circumstances leading to the courts decisionmaking in toben 2003 fcafc 137 129 fcr 515 were similar in substance to those which have led to the bringing of the present proceedings and reflected a not dissimilar theme to the subject matter of complaint involving denial of the holocaust which preceded and continued throughout world war ii an attack upon the widespread exposure of those circumstances on the part of jewish people and assertions that jewish people exaggerated the number of jews killed in the holocaust for improper purposes the language the subject of complaint in toben was described by carr j at 45 as deliberately provocative and inflammatory and a flamboyantlyworded challenge and lacking in good faith those being descriptions adopted by the applicant in relation to its case against the respondents 9 i observe moreover that in the concurring appellate judgment of kiefel j in toben 2003 fcafc 137 129 fcr 515 her honour concluded at 77 that t he likelihood that the appellant wrote only to pursue the truth of those subjects is rendered implausible by this unnecessary aside which appears to have no real purpose in such a debate other than to disparage jewish people in my view it confirms what a reading of the article as a whole raises as a prospect namely that it was published with jewish people in mind as those responsible for concocting the holocaust and indeed as an attack upon them a similar approach has been adopted by mr jones in his presentation of the present case her honour agreed with carr j that there was no proof of the appellants ie tobens good faith 10 in the further concurring judgment of allsop j his honour made the following observation at 98 98 the above history taken from the works of scholars lerner and schwelb working contemporaneously with events is given to illuminate what it was that the international community was dealing with by this time in the twentieth century the nations of the world had experienced a century stained by amongst other catastrophes racial slaughter pogroms forced removal and relocations of whole peoples religious and ethnic genocide and were undergoing the trauma involved in the breakup and disintegration of colonial empires and national and regional political structures based on racial characteristics the unexpected recrudescence in the winter of 19591960 of some of the most recent and horrific manifestations of racist behaviour enlivened the world community to act swiftly and with an inevitable degree of variation in political perspective unanimously to take steps towards the elimination his honours emphasis of the perceived evil the perceived evil was all again his honours emphasis forms of racial discrimination and racial prejudice the manifestation of which had been in recent generations at times horrifically violent and strident at times overt and at times less overt and less brutal but nevertheless insidiously pervasive in any form it was recognised by all nations in the international community to strike at the dignity and equality of all human beings thereafter at 100101 his honour added 100 racial hatred was one form or manifestation of the perceived evil unhappily it was a form with which the nations in the general assembly in 1960 to 1965 were all too familiar it was the form of the perceived evil most likely to lead to brutality and violence but it was not the only form of the perceived evil antithetical to the dignity and equality inherent in all human beings upon which the charter of the united nations was based it was to all his honours emphasis such forms and manifestations that the convention was directed 101 the definition of racial discrimination in art 1 of the convention confirmed the wide aim of the convention article 1 1 in this convention the term racial discrimination shall mean any distinction exclusion restriction or preference based on race colour descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political economic social cultural or any other field of public life his honour then referred at some length to the public discussion and debate and to issues as to inroads into freedom of speech which led to the enactment of the rd act in australia 11 the material relied on in particular by the executive council of australian jewry was the bible believers newsletter 242 the copy before the court bearing the date 9 may 2005 it is 15 pages in length and contains the following segments inter alia i an introduction commencing we focus on the present truth what jesus is doing now seven pillars of jewish denial landmark court ruling against holocaust denier september 11 us

are not an instrument made under an act the most that can be said is that they were issued by the commissioner to ato officers as part of his general administration of the income tax assessment act 1936 cth the itaa s 8 of which provides the commissioner shall have the general administration of this act with respect to whether the decision was made under an instrument the applicants submit that tang establishes that the guidelines are an instrument for the purposes of the adjr act the high courts decision in that case departed from previous authority to the effect that documents issued under a general power of administration could not constitute an instrument under the adjr act as an illustration of that previous course of authority they refer to australian national university v lewins 1996 68 fcr 87 anu v lewins all earlier decisions on the matter must now be understood in light of the high courts consideration in tang of the expression a decision of an administrative character made under an enactment that case concerned a decision of griffith university through its relevant committee to exclude a postgraduate student ms tang from a program leading to the award of the degree of doctor of philosophy the decision was based on a finding that ms tang had engaged in academic misconduct the relevant admissionexclusion academic misconduct and appeal processes were the subject of policies adopted by the university council the policy documents were similar to the guidelines in the sense that although the making of them was within the power and mandate of the council as the universitys governing body under the griffith university act 1998 qld that act did not refer expressly or by implication to the laying down of the policies rather to do so was in the general power of the university council as the body having the general functions and powers of management given it by the act ms tang applied for review of the universitys decision under the judicial review act 1991 qld the issue was whether that decision was a decision of an administrative character made under an enactment a formula borrowed from the adjr act the university sought summary dismissal it failed at first instance in the supreme court of queensland and then before the queensland court of appeal the high court however by a 41 majority allowed the universitys appeal two judgments were delivered by the judges constituting the majority one by gleeson cj and the other by gummow callinan and heydon jj joint judgment in their joint judgment in tang gummow callinan and heydon jj pointed at 60 to dangers in looking at the expression a decision of an administrative character made under an enactment otherwise than as a whole their honours quoted the following passage from aronson mi dyer bd groves m judicial review of administrative action 3 rd ed lawbook co 2004 pp 7374 footnotes omitted the recent trend is to treat decisions which can find no other statutory source of authority than such a clause giving power or even a duty to administer an act and to do all things necessary in that regard as not being made under an enactment for adjr purposes although there has been scant attempt to identify why that approach should be adopted as a matter of principle original emphasis their honours noted at 78 that while a decision in order to be susceptible to review under the adjr act must be either expressly or by implication authorised or required by an enactment requirement or authority is not alone sufficient the further stipulation that the decision must be of an administrative character meant that there must be an affecting of legal rights and obligations their honours said at 80 do legal rights or duties owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement cf r v commonwealth court of conciliation and arbitration ex parte barrett at 154 to adapt what was said by lehane j in lewins anu v lewins at 103 does the decision in question derive from the enactment the capacity to affect legal rights and obligations are legal rights and obligations affected not under the general

rights and obligations nor do legal rights of the commissioner or duties of the applicants in relation to the production of documents 226 to 238 owe in an immediate sense their existence to the decision or depend upon the presence of the decision for their enforcement tang at 80 it is o 33 r 12 and the general law that give the commissioner procedural rights and impose on the applicants procedural obligations gummow callinan and heydon jj did not see it as an obstacle to their view the fact that the terms of the policy and other circumstances may well have created an expectation in ms tang that any withdrawal from her phd candidature would only follow upon the fair treatment of complaints against her their honours said at 92 that such an expectation would not create in ms tang any substantive rights under the general law which would render the decision she challenged a decision made under the universitys act a similar observation is to be made in relation to the guidelines they are calculated to create an expectation that they will be adhered to by the commissioner however that expectation does not convert a nonreviewable decision into a reviewable one the following summary paragraph at 96 of the joint judgment in tang concludes their honours discussion of the issues and immediately precedes their discussion of the orders to be made the decisions of which the respondent complains were authorised albeit not required by the university act the committees involved depended for their existence and powers upon the delegation by the council of the university under ss 6 and 11 of the university act but that does not mean that the decisions of which the respondent complains were made under the university act in the sense required to make them reviewable under the review act the decisions did not affect legal rights and obligations they had no impact upon matters to which the university act gave legal force and effect the respondent enjoyed no relevant legal rights and the university had no obligations under the university act with respect to the course of action the latter adopted towards the former this passage applies mutatis mutandis to the guidelines and to mr oneills decision under them i turn now to consider other authorities to which i was referred in tang gummow callinan and heydon jj described at 84 as a sound ground of nonreviewability black cjs reference to the commissioners voting decision as one that was not given statutory effect by s 8 of the itaa for the reasons given above the application is incompetent in so far as it relies on the adjr act sections 39b1 and 1a of the judiciary act in this case the jurisdictional question under s 39b1 is whether the proceeding is a matter in which certiorari or an injunction is sought against an officer of the commonwealth it is not suggested that the commissioner and mr oneill an assistant commissioner of taxation are not such officers the applicants seek an order quashing or setting aside mr oneills decision and an injunction restraining the respondents from seeking access to documents 226 to 238 the court therefore has jurisdiction under s 39b1 of the judiciary act the question that remains in relation to s 39b1 is whether the applicants have no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding ie gaining the order and injunction they seek in the present state of the evidence and exploration of the legal issues involved i am not persuaded that they have no reasonable prospects of success of doing so evidence has not been filed

23600,28,17,326,10,9523,after setting out the passage which appears at 45 in applicant nabd of 2002 v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs 2005 hca 29 2005 216 alr 1 per mchugh j the writer continues proselytizing in indonesia is prohibited by law where it is considered a criminal offence breach of such law may lead to imprisonment and other penalties we also note that proselytizing by christians is viewed generally as contrary to the beliefs of islam the latest report on religious freedom in indonesia states that the government bans proselytizing arguing that such activity especially in areas heavily dominated by members of another religion could prove disruptive a joint decree issued by the ministries of religion and home affairs in 1979 prohibits members from one religion from trying to convert members of other faiths example of criminalization of proselytizing is regulation 86uu no23 2002 child protection which says any person who purposely uses deception lies and enticement to make a child choose another religion not of his own free will whereas it is known or should be assumed that the child is not of age and not responsible according to the religion they followed will be prosecuted by imprisonment for five years andor a fine of rp 1000000000 sic it is submitted that the law criminalizing proselytizing is not a law of general application we submit that the law prohibiting proselytizing is persecutory not prosecutory 71 whether a law banning proselytization is a law of general application will depend upon its terms and the way in which it is enforced the example cited in the above extract could hardly be said to be anything other than a law of general application it prohibits misleading conduct directed at children there could be little doubt that such legislation was designed to serve a legitimate public purpose a childs religion is a matter for his or her parents or guardians however it seems to have been accepted that there is a wider prohibition upon proselytization in indonesia the source and terms of which are not in evidence in particular there is no evidence as to whether the law only bans attempts to persuade persons to adopt a particular religion or whether it also applies to attempts to dissuade persons from following one religion or all religions in the former case it might be said that the legislation applies only to persons who wish to recruit adherents and that in that sense it applies only to persons who are already members of particular religious organizations in the latter case the application is wider and perhaps more easily characterized as being of general application 72 for present purposes it is sufficient to note that the question of legislation prohibiting proselytization was raised by the appellants solicitors who submitted that such legislation was not of general application the question having been raised by the appellant the tribunal necessarily had to address it i can see no basis for holding that before doing so it was obliged to invite the appellant further to address the matter the appellant was not entitled to assume that the question would be resolved in her favour the tribunal offered her an opportunity to advance her case at the hearing no more was required 73 on appeal the appellant again asserted that the tribunal was obliged to give notice of its intention to find against her on the basis that the law was of general application andor that it was appropriate and adapted to a legitimate social purpose for reasons which i have given i reject that submission in so far as it concerns the question of general application as to the question of whether the law was appropriate and adapted to a legitimate purpose i consider that in raising the question of the laws general application the appellants solicitors inevitably raised the question of appropriateness to attempt to distinguish between the two aspects given the way in which the matter has been treated in the cases would be quite artificial there was no obligation on the tribunal to invite the appellant further to address the issue 74 i turn to the question of whether the tribunal addressed the extent to which the appellant would be restricted in her chosen method of practising her religion in my view the tribunal disposed of this ground by its finding that laws restricting proselytization were general laws appropriate and adapted to a legitimate purpose and by its finding that such harassment as the appellant might experience in indonesia would not amount to persecution particularly given the availability of state protection the effect of those findings was that the appellant would be free to engage in works of mercy subject to her complying with the law as to proselytization and subject to the risk of low level harassment against which she would have state protection such findings have not been challenged the firstmentioned limitation was not discriminatory and therefore not persecutory the second limitation did not amount to persecution as defined in s 91r it follows that the appellant did not have a wellbased fear of persecution for reason of her religion

a conventional way according to their submissions the tribunal was not there suggesting that the capm formula could be applied only in a way that was consistent with an acceptance of its underlying assumptions consideration general 252 as previously noted telstra led expert evidence from professor stephen faulkner gray professor of finance at uq business school university of queensland and also the managing director of the strategic finance group sfg consulting also as noted above optus led expert evidence from jason peter ockerby a director of the competition economists group the nonoptus access seekers led expert evidence from dr thomas nicholas hird also of the competition economists group the three economists provided a joint report of experts joint report to the court they also provided their own independent reports and gave extensive oral evidence the authorities 253 the authorities referred to by telstra see 219 above concerned statutory contexts different from the present one they required that a value or a value of a particular kind or an amount of compensation be determined and in some instances the basic expressions were elaborated upon or defined accordingly the argument was open in those cases that the statute had been misconstrued 270 i see no ground for criticism of acccs reasoning process by which it rejected telstras capital strike proposition it was at liberty to consider that in the real world investors do not behave in the way in which the capital strike proposition would have them behave accordingly in this respect accc did not behave unreasonably or irrationally and neither error of law nor wednesbury unreasonableness is made out inconsistency and application by gasnet australia operations pty ltd 2003 acompt 6 2004 atpr 41978 2003 acompt 6 271 telstras contention that there is a fundamental inconsistency in relying on the capm and accepting the heterogeneity of investor expectations is well expressed at 68 of telstras submissions to accc the conventional versions of the capital asset pricing model capm to which both the commission and the tribunal refer in their previous regulatory decisions do not extend in any simple way to heterogeneous investor information and expectations as a result if the commission and the tribunal genuinely hold the view that investors have heterogeneous information and expectations they cannot continue to rely on the models they have conventionally used to determine allowed ratesofreturn to do so would be to contradict the requirement the tribunal has set out in earlier decisions that the capm be applied in a manner consistent with its underlying assumptions the reference in the last section to earlier decisions is a reference to the tribunals decision in gasnet at 47 the tribunal there stated the accc erred in concluding that it was open to it to apply the capm in other than the conventional way to produce an outcome which it believed better achieved the objectives of s 81 in truth and reality the use of different values for a risk free rate in the working out of a rate of return by the capm formula is neither true to the formula nor a conventional use of the capm it is the use of another model based on the capm with adjustments made on a pragmatic basis to achieve an outcome which reflects an attempt to modify the model to one which operates by reference to the regulatory period of five years the capm is not a model which is intended to operate in this way the timescales are dictated by the relevant underlying facts in each case and for present purposes those include the life of the assets and the term of the investment the reference to s 81 is a reference to s 81 of the national third party access code for natural gas pipeline systems section 81 set out the objectives according to which a reference tariff and reference tariff policy were to be designed i do not think that the tribunals observation at 47 set out above is relevant to the question whether accc was obliged in order to be consistent to accept as according with the real world the assumptions according to which the capm was formulated inconsistency and the expert evidence 272 i do not find it necessary or think it desirable to attempt to describe comprehensively the effect of the totality of the evidence of the expert witnesses but certain aspects of the joint report in particular are noteworthy 273 the experts agreed that the required return on equity capital cannot be estimated with great precision the sharpelintner capm relies on a number of assumptions that are unrealistic one of which is that of homogeneous investor expectations about the future prospects of each firm the sharpelintner capm pricing relation can be derived adopting assumptions different from those originally employed by sharpe and lintner one of those different assumptions being that investors have heterogeneous expectations about the future prospects of each firm but other assumptions are required to arrive at the relation and the pricing relation may hold only approximately the sharpelintner capm allows investors to have heterogeneous attitudes towards risk different levels of risk aversion the pricing relationship used by accc was consistent with that originally developed by sharpe and lintner and also that subsequently derived from it using the assumption of heterogeneous expectations and other additional assumptions heterogeneity of risk aversion is already allowed for in the sharpelintner capm

22018,98,17,408,378,44369,the duty of a judicial officer to provide reasons for decisions made and the content of that duty were best articulated by meagher ja in beale v government insurance office of nsw 1997 48 nswlr 430 his honour there initially addressed the obligation to provide reasons and then the purpose of providing reasons his honour at 441 2 thus observed the obligation to provide reasons for decision it is well settled that a judge or magistrate at first instance in particular cases has an obligation to provide reasons for the judgment given that obligation arises as a matter of judicial duty but only as a normal not universal incident of the judicial process it does not arise from legislation as it does in the field of administrative law see for example administrative decisions judicial review act cth s13 administrative appeals tribunal act cth s28 s37 and s43 despite the fact that the obligation on courts to provide reasons may have a different origin the former being an incident of judicial duty and the latter being a legislative requirement there is no reason in principle or as a matter of policy why the content of reasons for both types of decision should not be similar if not the same they essentially serve the same purpose the purpose of providing reasons for decision perhaps the primary reason for an obligation on courts to provide reasons is the fact that a party seeking an appeal may generally only appeal where the trial judge has made an error of law the absence of reasons or insufficient reasons may not allow an appeal court to determine whether the trial judges verdict was or was not based on an error of law or an appealable error however the provision of full reasons has other benefits a failure to provide sufficient reasons can and often does lead to a real sense of grievance that a party does not know or understand why the decision was made this court has previously accepted the proposition that a judge is bound to expose his reasoning in sufficient detail to enable a losing party to understand why they lost one reason is obvious if decisions cannot be understood a feeling of injustice can arise and as justice brennan of the united states supreme court see huxtable a questionmark over the adversarial system dee 1995 30 no 11 australian lawyer 17 recently perhaps overstated nothing rankles more in the human heart than a brooding sense of injustice illness we can put up with but injustice makes us want to pull things down aside from the sense of injustice which can be caused there is a broader interest in maintaining public acceptance of judicial decisions and the judicial system the requirement to provide reasons can operate prophylactically on the judicial mind guarding against the birth of an unconsidered or impulsive decision it enhances judicial accountability the provision of reasons has an educative effect it exposes the trial judge or magistrate to review and criticism and it facilitates and encourages consistency in decisions the educative effect does not stop with judges but extends to other lawyers to government and to the public decisions of courts usually influence the way in which society acts and it is trite to point out that it is better to understand why one should act in a particular way the provision of adequate reasons will save time for appeal courts both in reducing the number of appeals and in reducing the time taken in considering any appeals thus any increase in judicial resources required at the trial level should be countered by a reduction in judicial resources required at the appellate level 22 the position taken by the respondent minister however was essentially threefold namely that i the observations of meagher ja in beale as to the content of adequate reasons for a decision at first instance do not provide an appropriate touchstone as to those matters which the federal magistrate was obliged to address in the present proceedings ii the reasons in fact provided by the federal magistrate did adequately explain the decision reached and iii in the event that there was a deficiency in those reasons this court as a matter of discretion should decline to allow the appeal if satisfied that the decision of the federal magistrate could be supported albeit for reasons not disclosed by the federal magistrate but which can be ascertained by this court 23 the first of those submissions must readily be accepted there is a fundamental distinction between the responsibilities of a trial judge entrusted with the function of making findings of fact as in beale and the responsibilities of a judge conducting judicial review central to that distinction is that in judicial review proceedings the factual merits of the decision under review are left to the decisionmaker and the court conducting the judicial review is confined to a review of the legality of the decision reached 24 that distinction necessarily dictates a reconsideration of the approach set forth by meagher ja in beale the federal magistrates task in the present proceedings was to review the decision of the refugee review tribunal that was essentially a task of considering the terms of the relevant legislation and reviewing the conclusions expressed by the tribunal as against the findings of fact and reasons provided and that task is confined by s 476 of the migration act 1958 cth 25 those matters which a federal magistrate it is considered should address in reasons for decision will depend upon the factual and legal issues involved in those circumstances where the ground of judicial review being relied upon is a denial of procedural fairness it may be appropriate for the federal magistrate to consider evidence not before the tribunal but evidence that is directed to the manner in which the tribunal proceeded that evidence may be contested and it may be necessary to make findings of fact where however the ground of review is said to be an error of law it may be unnecessary to go beyond the findings of fact made by the tribunal and the legislative provisions being applied 26 whatever the ground of review however the reasons of the federal magistrates court must be sufficient to explain to both the litigant and others the basis upon which that court proceeded and the reasons why the application to review the decision of the tribunal is either to be dismissed or why the decision is said to be wrong in law reasons do not adequately address the grounds of review sought to be resolved if the litigant or this court is left to speculate as to what it was that the federal magistrate had in mind when he reached the conclusions that formed the final decision 50 it should finally be noted that the adequacy of reasons provided must necessarily be determined in the context of each individual case as concluded by meagher ja in beale supra no mechanical formula can be given in determining what reasons are required the adequacy of the reasons provided by the federal magistrates court must also be necessarily influenced by the volume of decisions especially migration decisions resolved by that court 51 the orders of the court are 1 the appeal be allowed 2 the orders of howard fm in the federal magistrates court of australia on 17 january 2008 be set aside 3 the proceedings be remitted to howard fm for determination in

501 the direction part 2 of the direction concerns the exercise of the discretion under s 5012 once a decision has been made that the character test is not satisfied a matter which is conceded by mr green in this case part 2 provides that when exercising the discretion decisionmakers must have regard to three primary considerations namely the protection of the australian community the expectations of the australian community and if relevant the best interests of any children involved other considerations which are not primary considerations and are not mandatory include the effects on the visaholders family evidence of rehabilitation the likelihood of breaching or evading obligations under a legal or other ongoing matter the duration of the proposed stay in australia and whether the visa is permanent or temporary 11 paragraph 25 of the direction identifies three factors which are relevant to the protection of the australian community they are the seriousness and nature of the conduct the likelihood of recidivism and whether visa cancellation would provide general deterrence 12 of importance to this case is the process laid down by the direction for considering the seriousness and the nature of the conduct of a noncitizen paragraph 26 outlines what the minister views as serious offences and paragraph 27 states that the sentence imposed for a crime is an appropriate indicator of the seriousness of the offenders conduct against the community paragraph 28 then provides that decisionmakers must take into account certain mitigating considerations when exercising discretion decisionmakers must also take the following factors into account as relevant considerations a any relevant factors provided by the noncitizen as mitigating factors b the offence is not classified as an offence in australia c a lighter sentence would be incurred in australia for a similar offence or d the noncitizen has been pardoned emphasis added 13 the tribunals reasons

and described the events leading up to the cancellation of his visa by the minister and his detention on 16 august 2005 14 the tribunals reasons summarised the evidence led by mr green most of which pertained to mr greens explanation of his personal history how and why he came to possess a criminal record and also some mitigating circumstances his reasons in short were that he had led a life of few opportunities and that he had unfortunately been surrounded by bad kids then bad adults the tribunal described mr greens time in prison and noted his evidence which stated that he was not a vicious outlaw type of criminal but rather more of the robin hood type the tribunal also discussed mr greens developing drug addiction and the crimes he committed to support that addiction as well as the rehabilitation which mr green had sought in art and family 15 the tribunal found mr greens evidence unsatisfactory in certain respects it concluded at 53 that although mr greens evidence should not be entirely discarded his tendency towards exaggeration and opportunistic fabrication dictates a certain caution in evaluating it an observation as to the need for caution in this context does not mean that mr greens evidence was rejected out of hand 16 after making this finding the tribunal addressed the psychological and other evidence before it several psychological assessments of mr green were before the tribunal and although they appeared to differ in material respects the tribunal found at 64 it is difficult to derive much assistance from this part of the evidence other than to conclude that the applicant has psychological problems whether produced by drug abuse incarceration an unhappy childhood or a combination of all three he has not to date been able to shake off antisocial or selfdestructive patterns of behaviour but is not a hopeless case he could be rehabilitated and his development of his artistic capacities as well as his drug rehabilitation program are positive steps as is the possibility of employment and of continuing his relationship with a female friend 17 the tribunal then summarised other evidence provided by friends and family of mr green which detailed various matters of personal concern including the likelihood of mr green obtaining employment after his release from prison continuing an intimate relationship with a female friend and succeeding in an artistic career
199,38,18,300,95,43988,submission of santos delhi petroleum and the state that the application has no reasonable prospects of success is in summary a the applicants do not seek a determination of native title in the present proceeding b the definition of future act in s 2331 of the nta is that it is an act which apart from the nta either validly affects in the sense that word is to be understood in light of in s 227 of the nta native title in relation to the land or would if valid affect native title c in light of full courts judgment in the lardil peoples v queensland 2001 fca 414 2001 108 fcr 453 lardil to secure final relief of the kind sought by the applicants it is not sufficient to establish only that an act might affect native title if native title were found to exist d a corollary of this is that mere status as a registered native title claimant can never supply the requisite element in the definition of future act which is also an element in any entitlement to the relief sought the applicants in summary make the following submission in response a lardil is distinguishable because it related to procedural rights conferred by s 24ha and s 24na of the nta and not the right to negotiate under subdiv p of div 2 of pt 3 of that act b in any event the declaration that the grant of a petroleum lease would not constitute a preexisting rights based act does not require the applicants to establish that they have native title because if there is no valid atp it necessarily follows that there could be no valid grant of a petroleum lease the latter submission entails some exploration of the ability of this court to make any pronouncement in relation to the validity of an administrative actions arising only under state law that is best considered in conjunction with the separate jurisdictional challenge which santos and delhi petroleum make lardil is not distinguishable to the contrary that case confirms in a binding way what a reading of the definition of future act in s 233 of the nta would in any event suggest that is materially that a future act is one which affects native title not an act which if native title existed might affect it to construe the definition in the latter way would as french j as the chief justice then was observed in lardil at 473 59 require a rewriting of the statutory definition in s 233 which would significantly alter the operation of the act such a course is not justified by the language of a statute similar sentiments are evident in the judgments of the other members of the full court in lardil see p 476 70 per merkel j and p 486 114 per dowsett j the right to negotiate claimed by the applicants forms part subdiv p of div 3 of pt 2 of the nta regard to the overview of div 3 of pt 2 of the nta offered by s 24aa also exposes the flaw in the applicants position thus s 24aa1 accurately informs the reader that div 3 deals mainly with future acts which are defined in s 233 and that acts that do not affect native title are not future acts therefore this division does not deal with them emphasis added in turn s 24aa2 of the nta offers the accurate general observation that to the extent that a future act affects native title it will be valid if covered by certain provisions of the division and invalid if not these general propositions evident from the overview of div 3 are expressly articulated in s 24oa of the nta which provides 24oa future acts invalid unless otherwise provided unless a provision of this act provides otherwise a future act is invalid to the extent that it affects native title this section does not attend with invalidity a future act which might affect native title were the same to exist as in lardil the relief sought by the applicants is final relief in a proceeding where no claim for native title is advanced they rely on their status as the registered native title claimant yet the advancing and successful vindication of a native title claim not status as the registered native title claimant is given the definition of future act just as central to the application of provisions upon which the applicants rely as it was to those under consideration in lardil to seek to distinguish lardil on the basis that the rights within div 3 of pt 2 with which that case was concerned were procedural rights ignores this centrality for the purposes of s 31a of the fca act the respondents have established that the applicants have no reasonable prospect of securing any of the declaratory and injunctive relief which they seek insofar as they rely on other than state law for any part of that relief jurisdiction amp standing section 81 of the nta confers on the court jurisdiction to hear and determine applications that relate to native title read in isolation and as a matter of first impression and language the jurisdiction conferred by this section appears to require nothing more or less than a relevant connection between the subject matter of an application and native title in lardil though 108 fcr at 156 and 68 the conclusion was reached after a consideration of the context in which s 81 appears in the nta that the section confers jurisdiction only in respect of applications under pt 3 of that act this is not such an application perhaps recognising this the applicants did not point to s 81 as a source of jurisdiction to entertain their application instead they adverted to s 2132 of the nta to s 39b1ac of the judiciary act 1903 cth judiciary act and to s 21 of the fca act subject to the operation and effect of the other provisions of the nta s 2132 confers jurisdiction on the court in relation to matters arising under the act for its part s 39b1ac of the judiciary act confers jurisdiction with respect to matters arising under any laws made by the parliament the reference to s 21 of the fca act as a source of jurisdiction is misconceived that section operates where some other provision has conferred original jurisdiction on the court and in such circumstances empowers the court to make binding declarations of right whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed in other words s 21 is a source of power not jurisdiction common to each of s 39b1ac of the judiciary act and s 2132 of the nta is that the jurisdiction they confer is confined to the matters which those sections respectively specify no point was taken in lardil as to the absence in that case of a matter in the present case the amended statement of claim contains the following allegations the applicants on behalf of the wongkumara people are the registered native title claimant within the meaning of s 253 of the native title act 1993 cth the nta in respect of land in southwest queensland and northwest new south wales which land the claimed land is more particularly described in attachment b to native title determination application qud52 of 2008 as amended by leave granted by dowsett j on 12 april 2008 the first respondent and third respondent are recorded in the register kept under s 80a of the petroleum act 1923 qld the petroleum act as the holder of an authority to prospect atp 259p dated 31 january 1979 pursuant to the petroleum act in respect of land in southwest queensland the atp land which land lies wholly within the boundaries of the claimed land the second respondent is a government party within the meaning of s 261 of the nta for lands and water within the state of queensland 3a since the grant of atp 259p the first and third respondents have prospected and continue to prospect for petroleum on the atp land including the claimed land from about late 2005 representatives of the wongkumara people and of the first respondent on behalf of the itself and the third respondent and other companies being joint venture partners of the first and third respondents have been engaged in negotiations for an indigenous land use agreement the proposed ilua under the native title act 1993 cth nta which negotiations relate inter alia to proposed future acts under the nta in respect of the claimed land covered by the atp 4a the proposed ilua is to replace an indigenous land use agreement the former ilua that was part of an implementation agreement dated 16 january 2001 and which was in force for a term of five years 4b the former ilua was never registered under the nta in the course of negotiations for the former ilua and for the proposed ilua the first respondent on behalf of itself and its joint venture partners has claimed that because atp 259p predates the nta and the grant of a petroleum lease under the petroleum act is a preexisting rights based act perba within the meaning of subdivision i of division 3 of part 2 of the nta and as such is not subject to the right to negotiate provisions of subdivision p of division 3 of part 2 of the nta and should not be part of the negotiations for the proposed ilua particulars clause 94 of the former ilua letter dated 4 november 2005 from the first respondent to representatives of the wongkumara people the applicants have maintained that they are entitled to the right to negotiate under the nta in respect of the grant of petroleum lease over the claimed land covered by the atp and that the grant of a petroleum lease should be part of the negotiations for the proposed ilua particulars clause 94 of the former ilua letter dated 18 june 2008 from eddy neumann lawyers solicitors for the applicant to the first respondent atp 259p was originally issued on 31 january 1979 for a term of four years commencing n 1 january 1979 from time to time thereafter the term of atp 259p has purportedly been varied extended or renewed particulars a 22 december 1982 variation by which the term was renewed for four years commencing on 1 january 1983 b 18 december 1986 variation by which the term was extended for four years commencing on 1 january 1987 c 7 may 1991 renewal by which the atp was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 january 1991 d 20 september 1995 renewal by which the atp was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 january 1995 e 24 june 1999 renewal by which the atp was renewed for a term of four years commencing on 1 january 1999 f 12 december 2003 variation by which the term of the atp was extended for four years commencing on 1 january 2003 g 3 january 2008 renewal by which the term of the atp was renewed for a term of four years commencing january 2007 read with the relief sought by the applicants the amended statement of claim offers in my opinion a paradigm example of an impermissible attempt to secure an advisory opinion what is revealed is nothing more than a difference in contractual negotiating positions between the applicants who claim in other proceedings but have not yet been determined to hold native title in respect of the claimed land and santos and delhi petroleum who may one day seek to obtain from the state a petroleum lease in respect over part of the claimed land on the strength of atp259p it is not pleaded that any such lease has been granted or is even imminently to be granted in effect what the applicants seek is advice as to whether were it to be determined that they hold native title and were a petroleum lease to be sought by and granted to santos or to delhi petroleum by the state that lease if otherwise valid would be an invalid future act if the negotiation requirements found in subdiv p of div 3 of pt 2 of the nta were not complied with the hypothetical nature of the application is self evident to adapt the language employed by zamir i and lord woolf in the passage quoted the question would only be whether the applicants santos and delhi petroleum were generally obliged to act in a certain way before anything more meaningful than an answer to that question could be given the legal and factual issues just mentioned would have to be determined and occur in lardil at 490 136 dowsett j expressly adverted to the question of whether the applicants in that case had standing to pursue the claim for relief insofar as it sought a declaration of invalidity under state law his honour doubted that they had standing nonetheless he went on to consider the state law question ultimately concluding that the decision sought to be impugned was valid of the other judges french j in the minority as to this aspect of the case was of the view that there was no jurisdiction to determine the state law question though merkel j expressed his agreement with the conclusion reached by dowsett j as to the validity of the decision under state law his honour did not in terms expressly extend that agreement to the doubt as to standing which had been expressed by dowsett j in lardil the majority concluded that the court had jurisdiction to decide the state law question of the validity of an act under that law because deciding that question was an essential step in any determination of whether there was a future act under the nta here the applicants have commenced an application not materially distinguishable from lardil which in light of that case is doomed to fail with respect to its federal aspects the essential connection with the federal question provides the only jurisdiction which the court could have to decide the state law question in those circumstances if there were jurisdiction to entertain the federal question the deciding of the state law question would be a matter of accrued jurisdiction in respect of which s 23 of the fca act would operate so as to confer jurisdiction in light of lardil and the fact that the present case is not materially distinguishable from that authority the present case was doomed to fail the federal law aspect of the application was therefore in the sense the term is used in the cases colourable that has the consequence that there is no jurisdiction to entertain the state law aspect of the claim even if the applicants had standing exercise of discretion in the event that the foregoing conclusions are wrong i should nonetheless not be disposed to the grant declaratory relief in respect of so much of the claim as remained and relied for its foundation on the state law question of whether it was lawfully possible to grant petroleum leases on the strength of atp 259p that would turn on a question as to whether on the particular dates pleaded there was a power of renewal in the petroleum act or otherwise under state law lardil indicates that jurisdiction would in these contingent circumstances exist to determine such a question in the accrued jurisdiction

10317,33,40,451,345,1339,the applicants drew attention to what was said to be the correct legal position located within paras 52 53 and 64 of the reasons for judgment of mummery lj in dacas v brook street bureau uk ltd 2004 irlr 358 with which sedley lj was essentially in agreement brook street was a united kingdom court of appeal decision the context whereof related to labour hire arrangements between brook street bureau uk ltd a well known employment agency and a local councils mental health hostel for the periodic cleaning thereof which in the events that happened were physically undertaken at material times by the applicant mrs dacas the court of appeal comprised mummery and sedley ljj whose reasons for decision were essentially in line and munby j who differed materially in what may be described as doctrinal reasoning to that of the other two members of the court while reaching nevertheless the same ultimate decision the difficulty to an understanding of the substrata to the appeal in its various aspects as well as in its outcome lies largely in relation to the procedural context to the appeal for present purposes i will confine my consideration of the differences in principle concerning the implications of labour hire though obiter apparent in the reasons for decision of each of mummery and sedley ljj compared to those of munby j and to the extent to which the statements of principle emerging from the respective reasons for judgment in brook street may have an operation in relation to the issues presently arising 84 i would commence my consideration of the respective parties approaches to the implications of brook street by recording that in the leading judgment mummery lj observed that had the court of appeal been seized of all of the circumstances of the case it may well have been open for the court of appeal to have found that mrs dacas was an employee of the local council to whom the services of mrs dacas had been provided by brook street bureau by way of labour hire and against which local council their lordships considered that her case for unfair dismissal should have been prosecuted rather than the labour hire agency brook street bureau as i foreshadowed sedley lj took a similar approach in reasoning as well as in outcome to that taken by mummery lj however munby j adopted what i think may be described as the more conventional analytical approach 85 it was in that context broadly stated that mummery lj made the following observations concerning the local borough councils status as an employer or principal in relation to mrs dacas which the applicants contended to be reflective of the correct approach here required to be adopted in principle 17 the critical point is that although the construction of the contractual documents is important it is not necessarily determinative of the contract of service questions as contractual documents do not always cover all the contractual territory or exhaust all the contractual possibilities in determining the true nature of the relationship if any between each of the respective parties it is necessary to consider the total situation occupied by the parties although there was no express contract between the applicant and the enduser in this case that absence does not preclude the implication of a contract between them that depends on the evidence which includes but may not be confined to the contractual documents 52 the formal written contracts may not tell the whole of the story about the legal relationships affecting the work situation they do not as a matter of law necessarily preclude the implication of a contract of service there may be evidence of a pattern of regular mutual contact of a transactional character from which a contract of service may be implied by the tribunal 53 i approach the question posed by this kind of case on the basis that the outcome which would accord with practical reality and common sense would be that if it is legally and factually permissible to do so the applicant has a contract which is not a contract of service with the employment agency and that the applicant works under an implied contract which is a contract of service with the enduser and is therefore an employee of the enduser with a right not to be unfairly dismissed the objective fact and degree of control over the work done by mrs dacas at west drive over the years is crucial the council in fact exercised the relevant control over her work and over her the fact that the obligations were contained in express contracts made between mrs dacas and brook street and between brook street and the council does not prevent them frombeing read across the triangular arrangements into an implied contract and taking effect as implied mutual obligations as between mrs dacas and the council 86 cao submitted that the foregoing analysis of mummery lj and similarly that of sedley lj falls rather short and that the first question to be asked and answered is whether there was a contract at all between the worker and 1 the ultimate client of the labour hire agency or 2 the labour hire agency cao seemingly acknowledged at the outset that in some circumstances there may be an overlap between the issue of intention to create legal relations and issues of agreement and consideration reference being made in that regard to carter j w and harland d j contract law of australia 4 th ed butterworths 2002 p 163 in any event it was further submitted by cao that whilst mummery lj did not explicitly identify what cao described as that fundamental issue in contract law there was conceivably just an echo of it in his lordships reasons at 52 partly extracted above nevertheless so the cao submissions continued his lordship did not indicate it was necessary first to consider whether or not the relevant parties intended to enter upon legal relations that absence of indication was said by cao to also reside in the reasoning of sedley lj where his honours discussion at 75 of the legal status of a worker was described by counsel for cao as rather too compressed and which reasoning had failed to address the fundamental questions of contractual analysis 87 cao submitted further that it could not be correct and would be contrary to australian authority for this court to consider what is the nature of any implied contract before first answering the question did the parties intend to create legal relations and further that the mere attendance by one party at the workplace of another does not give rise to the implication of a contract between those parties sedley js reasoning impermissibly conflates the separate stages of contractual enquiry cao further submitted by way of contrast that munby j appeared to approach the case in a more conventional way than was taken by mummery and sedley ljj and to have included the issue of intention in the mix of issues for considering what the facts actually proved including whether or not there was a contract with anyone at all i have explored in more comprehensive detail caos submissions in relation to brook street later in these reasons 88 the applicants next drew attention to the decision of the united kingdom court of appeal in cable amp wireless plc v muscat 2006 irlr 354 handed down subsequently to brook street where it was found by majority that a labour hire worker was employed by the host rather than by the agency through which the host had directed that he be engaged whilst the applicants acknowledged the facts in cable and wireless were distinguishable from brook street the applicants placed reliance upon the acknowledgment by the court of appeal in cable amp wireless upon the majoritys views in brook street which they submitted to be seemingly to the effect that so long as remuneration is being provided in reality by the employer it matters not that it is not paid directly by that employer but by a third party pursuant to another arrangement made by the employer with that third party quoting from cable amp wireless the applicants asserted that a person who would otherwise be the workers employer did not cease to be his employer by arranging for the wages to be paid per medium of a third party and further that the essentials of a contract of employment are the obligation to provide work for remuneration and the obligation to perform it coupled with control whether the arrangements for payment are made directly or indirectly i will later return to a further discussion of cable amp wireless in the context of caos submissions 92 it was therefore submitted by the applicants that the facts as to the total employment relationship demonstrate that there was an employment relationship between each of them and cao from the commencement of their employment at the hvo alternatively it was submitted by the applicants that an employment relationship came into existence before 1 july 2002 that being the commencement time of the claim additionally as i have foreshadowed it was submitted by the applicants that in principle conduct which might not have manifested a mutual intention to enter into a contract had it lasted only a brief time may become unequivocal if it is maintained over a lengthy period of time referring thereby to the reasons of mummery lj at 17 in brook street of course as i have already mentioned sedley lj adopted a similar approach but munby j chose to differ 157 i have taken the course of reviewing the united kingdom court of appeal authorities of brook street and cable amp wireless in some detail because of the extent to which the applicants sought to place reliance upon the approach and findings apparent in the respective reasons for judgment in the case of brook street referrable to the reasoning of mummery and selby ljj and in the case of cable amp wireless referrable to the approach taken generally in the joint judgment of all members of the court of appeal caos submission was to the effect that the reasons in both decisions other than that of munby j in brook street should not be accorded any effective much less decisive operation in relation at least to the relevant circumstances of the present case which cao has outlined i will first address caos submissions relating to brook street 158 cao emphasised at the outset the obiter nature of what it sought to isolate as significant aspects of the reasoning of mummery and sedley ljj in brook street to the effect that should the tripartite arrangements the subject of consideration in those proceedings appear in the future differently structured it may be open to an employment tribunal to find that a respondent such as mrs dacas was an employee of the brook street labour hire agency pursuant to an implied contract of service see 68 appearing within the reasons of the leading judgment of mummery lj cao contended that obiter observations to any such effect should not be adopted by an australian superior court moreover cao drew attention to what was said to have been acknowledged by mummery lj at 4950 to the effect that the notion of a contract of service requires the existence of at least minimum obligations as to the provision of work and conversely of obligations to perform that work in the context of control by the provider of the work cao further emphasised in any event what was said by his lordship at 49 concerning the need to eschew notions to the effect that an individual is an employee simply because he is not a self employed person but contended that if there was no interposed employment agency there would be no doubt that even in the absence of an express contract mrs dacas worked under a contract of service with the council it was managing and controlling work done by her in the mutual expectation that she would be paid for what she was told to do and had in fact done being a contention not at least directly relevant 159 cao drew attention to the purported characterisation of the socalled triangular arrangement appearing at 5253 of the reasons of mummery lj i have already extracted earlier at 85 in these reasons much of what appears in 53 in 51 his lordship referred to the legitimacy of having regard to the fact if it be the case that a series or a number of transactions are intended to operate in combination with one another or are ingredients of a wider transaction intended as a whole that approach does not sit readily with the approach taken in the australian authorities in relation to circumstances involving labour hire operators such as in forstaff caos contentions were in summary to the effect that the analysis of mummery lj and implicitly therefore also of sedley lj fell rather short in that the first issue normally required to be resolved in labour hire cases such as brook street is simply whether there existed a contract at all between the worker and the client of the labour hire agency or else between the worker and the labour hire agency i was referred to ermogenous and teen ranch both of which involved an issue as to whether the parties mutually intended to enter into a contractual relationship the element of intention in that regard being paramount the respective factual circumstances in those united kingdom and australian cases were some distance removed from the industrial context of the relationships involved in the present proceedings 160 cao contended further in relation to brook street that neither mummery lj nor sedley lj clearly and crisply asked and answered what cao would contend to have been the critical issue namely did the council and mrs dacas intend to enter upon legal relations before proceeding to consider the nature of any implied contract cao contended that it could not be correct and would be contrary to australian authority for a court to enter upon a consideration of the nature of an implied contract before first resolving the issue as to whether or not the parties in dispute intended to create or enter upon a legal relationship in the first place it was emphasised by cao in that regard that merely the regular attendance by a person at the workplace of another person does not give rise to the implications of a contract between those persons and moreover that his lordships reasoning geared to the doctrine of implied contracts impermissibly conflates the separate stages of contractual enquiry there is in my opinion force in principle inherent in those cao submissions as to shortfalls in any assistance to be derived from the leading judgments in brook street 161 the differing approach of munby j as the third member of the court of appeal in brook street adopted at 83 what cao described as a more conventional position in terms of authority his lordships starting point was that the mere fact that there is a contract between the worker and the agency and another contract between the agency and the enduser plainly does not prevent there also being a contract between the worker and the enduser nor of itself does it prevent any contract between the worker and the enduser being a contract of service that approach is more in line with australian authority and also with the united kingdom approach taken subsequently in viasystems in relation to what was described in the concluding sentence of 80 by rix lj where munby js reasoning departed at least implicitly from the approach of the other members of the court of appeal was in his isolation at 83 of two critical elements of an employment relationship namely the obligation to remunerate and the right to control munby j cited authority stating that the mutuality of obligation and the requirement of control on the part of the potential employer are the irreducible minimum for the existence of a contract of employment his lordship further cited authority to the effect that t he significance of mutuality is that it determines whether there is a contract in existence at all and that t he significance of control is that it determines whether if there is a contract in place it can properly be classified as a contract of service rather than some other kind of contract moreover munby j considered at 87 that t he requirement that there be mutuality of obligation necessarily focuses attention on the obligations if any undertaken by the enduser which his lordship described as not inclusive of any obligation to provide the servant with work in addition to wages any such latter obligation being not very often to be found expressed in written contracts of employment 164 it was accordingly submitted by cao that the reasoning of munby j in brook street constituted a compelling demolition of the rather confusing approach by the majority united kingdom court of appeal in that case and a powerful cause for this court not following that approach after concluding his analysis of authority munby j drew together at 101103 which i have reproduced below his reasons for disagreement with the majority in brook street which i have foreshadowed and in so doing formulated an approach which cao asserted to be here applicable to the determination of the present proceedings 101 where with all respect i part company with my lords is in relation to three matters the first is the suggestion that the objective fact and degree of control over the work done by mrs dacas over the years is crucial that as it seems to me somewhat overstates the position and in any event it does not seem to me with all respect to meet the point made by elias j in the stephenson case 102 the second is the suggestion that there is mutuality of obligation because the council was under an obligation to pay for the work that mrs dacas did for it and she received payment in respect of such work from brook street in this connection mummery lj asks rhetorically what was the council paying for if not the work done by mrs dacas under its direction and for its benefit the difficulty with this approach is that the council had no obligation to pay mrs dacas that brook streets obligation to pay her arose independently of whether or not brook street was paid by the council and that the council did not set the rate of her pay it needs also to be borne in mind that the sum contractually payable by the council to brook street was not simply the aggregate of the sums payable by brook street to mrs dacas and her fellow workers it will also have included in addition to brook streets profit an element reflecting the cost to brook street of meeting its various obligations to the council 103 the contract between brook street and the council was for the provision of services in accordance with a detailed specification and various other contractual documents the answer to my lords rhetorical question is that what the council was paying for was not the work done by mrs dacas and her fellow workers but the services supplied to it by brook street in accordance with the specification and the other contractual documents the monies paid by the council to brook street were not payments of wages nor were they calculated by reference to the wages payable by brook street to mrs dacas and her fellow workers there was no mutuality the rhetorical question above what was the council paying for merits emphasis in particular in the light of what seems to me to be the prevailing authority at least in australia to which i have referred and would seek to follow 165 hence cao submitted that it may clearly be seen by reference to the evidence placed before this court that the critical elements identified by munby j as fundamental to his lordships reasons for disagreement with the approach of the majority in brook street and which were said by cao to be fundamental to the resolution of the present issue arising according to the general law of australia require that this court should find that there was no contract of employment made between cao and each of the applicants cao identified that evidence to be in summary to the following effect i there was no mutuality of obligation cao being under no obligation to make payment to either of messrs wilton or cumberland for the work they respectively undertook at the hvo ii instead the only obligation as to the payment of remuneration or other benefits to either of the applicants was an obligation which rested with mes and not cao iii moreover the obligation of mes to pay each of the applicants arose independently of whether or not mes had been or was to be paid by cao for its supply of the applicants services iv the rates of pay which applied to each of the applicants were not set by cao but by an industrial instrument to which mes was a party and to which cao was not v the charges levied by mes upon cao pursuant to their discrete contractual arrangements did not simply represent the aggregate of the sums payable by mes to each of the applicants and for that matter to any other mes supplied workers for the time being but included a profit element for the benefit of mes and the costs otherwise incurred by mes in meeting its obligations to cao in relation to which mr touzell testified in his affidavit of 6 june 2006 being for instance costs of inducting those employees at the hvo personal protective equipment administration costs such as processing the pay for the employees to be supplied including of course messrs wilton and cumberland and other associated and incidental employment costs such as payroll tax and workers compensation insurance in respect of those employees so supplied vi the supply agreement entered into between cao and mes for the provision of services by mes to cao accorded with a detailed specification and vii what cao was paying purportedly in relation to the supply of services to it by mes was not just for the work done by each of the applicants per se but for the services supplied by mes in accordance with the relevant specification and other contractual documents in summary so the cao submission concluded there was no mutuality of obligation between cao and either of the applicants and moreover there was no intention to create legal relationships between the cao and either of the applicants accordingly there was no contract at all between cao and either of the applicants 166 cao further argued for completeness that the possible position left open in brook street being that the worker mrs dacas was an employee of the ultimate client of the labour hire agency was distinguishable from the circumstances the subject of the present proceedings because unlike the position described in the reasons for judgment of mummery lj in brook street at 64 i the applicants and mes were undeniably in an employment relationship inter se consistently with that mes paid to the applicants their respective wages ii the role of mes was not merely that of an agency finding suitable work assignments for each of the applicants iii mes provided certain clothing and personal protective equipment for use by the applicants in their working assignments in the hvo iv cao did not view mes as performing the task merely of staff supplier or administrator of staff services and v cao had its own individual instrument applicable to and governing its employment conditions and what it was otherwise obliged to observe and undertake in relation to its own employees discretely from those of mes 167 it was pointed out moreover by cao that the united kingdom court of appeal recognised in brook street in any event the force of the submission that control exercised by the end user in brook street was the product of the contractual arrangements between the labour hire agency and that end user in that regard i was referred to 67 of the reasons for judgment of mummery lj subsequent to which his lordship acknowledged at 68 at least the force of the arguments of brook streets counsel in attempted denial of the existence of any contract of service between that employment agency and mrs dacas incidentally in 67 his lordship observed also that i f the case raised policy issues as to the working conditions of people in the position of mrs dacas that was a matter for legislation by parliament and not for the courts 168 cao drew further attention once more to the significance of the circumstance that there was no contractual obligation imposed upon cao to provide either of the applicants with work and in that regard i was referred to brook street at 64 cao exemplified that circumstance by reference to the unavailability of work to the applicants and hence of any requirement for them to report for work at the hvo in the event of inclement weather or machinery breakdown and further that it was open to cao conversely to inform mes that it did not want a particular mes employee to work again at the mine for whatever reason if any 169 i would next move to a consideration of the detailed attention afforded by the parties to cable amp wireless which i have earlier foreshadowed that i would do more extensively in the context of my recitation of caos submissions than did the applicants cao having given perhaps more extensive attention to cable amp wireless that case was decided by the united kingdom court of appeal subsequently of course to brook street by a different bench being sir anthony clarke mr and smith and kay ljj the joint judgment of their lordships at 35 expressed the opinion that the view of the majority in dacas was correct it was submitted by cao nevertheless that the decision in cable amp wireless was not compelling in that the united kingdom court of appeal once more did not address the fundamental problem of intention to create legal relations as a threshold question or more precisely to create a contractual relationship in that latter regard it was submitted by cao that the court of appeals reasoning in cable amp wireless was out of step with the law in australia exemplifying in that regard ermogenous and teen ranch and in any event that the decision in cable amp wireless was of little relevance to the present case because of what was described as its vastly different factual circumstances 170 the factual context to cable amp wireless was different and more complex than in brook street and needs to be explained in some detail in order to provide an adequate understanding of the nature and extent of the issue which there arose for resolution and any conceivably comparable context to that involved in the present case the respondent mr muscat had been engaged as an employee of a telecommunications specialist with a company called exodus internet ltd eil when the company decided to reduce the number of its employees in order to facilitate a potential buyout but which nevertheless wanted to retain that workers services eil informed mr muscat that he would have to become a socalled contractor and to provide his services through a limited company his employment was thereupon terminated and a company named enuff comms ltd enuff was set up to receive his pay and car allowance about three months later eil was effectively taken over corporately by cable amp wireless mr muscat was described by cable amp wireless within the context of its organisational structure nevertheless as an employee and he was given accordingly an employee number the cost of all of the equipment upon or with which he worked was paid by cable amp wireless mr muscat continued to submit invoices for his services provided in the name of enuff since however cable amp wireless considered mr muscat to have remained associated with it though by then as a contractor cable amp wireless informed him that it would not deal with him directly but that as in the case of all other contractors seeking to make arrangements for the provision of their services to cable amp wireless he would have to engage with cable amp wireless through an agency entity called abraxas plc which had been retained to supply contracted personnel to cable amp wireless on 13 august 2002 enuff at least implicitly at mr muscats direction entered into a contract for services in favour of abraxas which included as a retrospective element the period of time up to when mr muscat became aware of the requirement for him to deal with cable amp wireless per medium of abraxas it was that contract for services which was described as crucial to the resolution of the cable amp wireless proceedings in that it was the case of cable amp wireless that such contract for services changed the status of mr muscat from that of its employee subsequently in late november 2002 cable amp wireless informed mr muscat that it would no longer require his services and on 31 december 2002 he ceased work directly or indirectly that is purportedly per medium of enuff and no longer by himself directly for cable amp wireless in march 2003 mr muscat made a claim for compensation upon cable amp wireless for unfair dismissal cable amp wireless contended in response that mr muscat was not its employee but that contention was rejected it being found that mr muscat held an implied contract of employment with cable amp wireless the notion of implied contract of employment had been postulated by mummery and sedley ljj in brook street 182 as to the controversial notion of implied relationships of employment and the significance thereof adopted by the two substantially concurring members of the united kingdom court of appeal in the labour hire context of brook street i would conclude as i have foreshadowed earlier in these reasons that there is no good reason for any imputation to the present circumstances of any such notion assuming that notion to be rightly cognisable in the general law of australia to the extent and for the purpose indicated in the brook street context of labour hire arrangements being an association which i think to be at best doubtful 183 it follows therefore from what i have thus far concluded in relation to the applicants submissions that there are doctrinal obstacles of significant judicial precedent cognisable by the general law of australia which stand in the way of recognition of any entitlement to the grant of the relief sought in the present proceedings that is not to say of course that a contract of employment whether oral or in writing may not contain implied terms and indeed such would i imagine normally or often be the case where the difficulty largely lies as exposed by the traditional approach taken by the third judgment in brook street is in imputing any implied contract of employment in circumstances of labour hire that being a transaction which inherently constitutes dual contractual arrangements one being between the provider of the hired worker and the hired worker and the other being between that provider of the hired worker and a third person who hires the secondmentioned person from the labour hire provider in order to obtain the performance of work from such hired person the implications relevantly of labour hire postulated in the reasons for judgment of merkel j in damevski at 174 as outlined in what is extracted in 34 above are in my opinion apposite to the present context
13123,98,17,482,420,46961,the respondent applied for a review of the registrars decision to adjourn the hearing of the creditors petition to 5 june 2006 on the review federal magistrate raphael upheld the registrars decision to adjourn the hearing of the creditors petition and in fact he altered the adjourned date from 5 june 2006 to 20 june 2006 george v hamiltonsmith 2006 fmca 566 the following passages from the federal magistrates reasons of 21 april 2006 should be noted at 4 12 and 13 4 the debtor claims she is solvent she says that she has tendered payment of the petitioning creditors debt and has a substantial cross claim against bernsteen which would effectively nullify any debt that she has to that company bernsteen is not in a position to make any payment to her as it is a company in liquidation she argues that another petitioning creditor cfs who had initially claimed a sum in excess of 2000000 has had its claim reduced to some 429753 which has now been paid what the debtor does not do is provide the court with any evidence about her financial circumstances there is no affidavit indicating what real property she owns what is the status of her bank accounts and what other assets are owned by her there is no evidence of other creditors there is no evidence that it was the debtor herself who paid the cfs debt or provided the funds for the tender to the petitioning creditor this lack of evidence meant that registrar christie was unable to be satisfied that the debtor was solvent and i am likewise unable to be satisfied of her solvency as registrar christie said in her judgment the debtor has not put before me the strong and tangible evidence necessary to establish that she is able to pay all her debts as and when they fall due see weinberg j in esanda finance corporation limited v velissaris 1999 fca 1359 at 17 12 even though the existence of the proceedings may not constitute sufficient cause to dismiss the sequestration order their existence might bear heavily upon an application for adjournment we are now in april the proceedings between the debtor and bernsteen are set down for hearing in may the proceedings between the debtor and the creditor are set down for hearing in early june i have heard nothing about any additional creditors but i am aware that the debtor has obtained an order for security for costs in the sum of 600000 against bernsteen in respect of those proceedings it is possible given the existence of these proceedings that bernsteen could obtain a similar and probably larger order against the debtor if she was permitted to pursue her cross claim 13 i have taken all these matters into account when considering whether or not to adjourn this petition as much as there is a public interest in bringing petitions to finality and thus preventing the possibility of insolvent trading or the incurring of debts a bankrupt is unable to repay there is also the fact that the making of a sequestration order has quasi criminal consequences re a judgment debtor 1908 3 kb 474 it puts severe restraints upon a bankrupts freedom of movement and ability to do business and it is these effects which must be weighed by a court considering an adjournment rather than the prejudice to the debtor or the prejudice to the creditor as suggested by registrar christie at 27 of her judgment in truth evidence on both of these matters is sorely lacking but i note that the debtor has not been totally unsuccessful in her previous litigious skirmishes eg in reducing the cfs debt down to a manageable figure i am of the view that whilst the current timetable for the forthcoming proceedings remains fixed with hearings in may and june the petition should be adjourned to allow those proceedings to be heard but if the debtor is unable to mount her cross claim without a significant adjournment or if the claim against the creditor is delayed then the rationale for the adjournment of the petition the speedy resolution of outstanding disputes will no longer apply registrar christie was unaware of the date of the hearing of the claim in the magistrates court between the creditor and the debtor but i have been informed that it is to take place on 13 june i will adjourn the petition until 20 june 2006 but i will grant the parties liberty to apply so that in the event that these hearing dates are not kept to an application can be made for an earlier hearing the petition and any such application will be returnable before registrar christie 29 on 20 june 2006 registrar christie heard and refused an application for discovery by the appellant which had only been filed the day before and she made the sequestration order which was reviewed by the federal magistrate 30 on 5 july 2006 federal magistrate raphael heard the application for review and on 19 july 2006 he made the sequestration order which is the subject of this appeal
4630,4,38,153,4,39413,the case before me involves the application of civil remedy provisions and penalties which can be awarded against the respondent if appropriate in my view the issue raised by mr hornemanwren may be addressed by recognising that the civil standard of proof that is the balance of probabilities is applicable as required by s 1401 evidence act however in applying the civil standard it is appropriate to take into account the issues prescribed in s 1402 this does not mean that i am required to apply a higher standard of proof than the mere balance of probabilities as submitted by counsel it does however require me in this case in applying the civil standard to take into account the nature of the claim the nature of the subjectmatter of the proceeding and the gravity of the matters alleged in particular in the context of a civil remedy provision i take into account the fact and the nature of the penalties which can be awarded against the respondent this approach is consistent with the approach taken by nicholson j in maritime union of australia 93 fcr at 65 the duty of the court in such cases to take into account issues specified in s 1402 has also been recognised in other federal court decisions including the employment advocate v national union of workers 2000 fca 710 2000 100 fcr 454 at 464 and hamberger v cfmeu 2000 104 ir 45 at 49

10943,77,39,37,31,24274,are three additional matters i should emphasise first i have emphasised that it is the review of the trustees decision that is of present concern the present is not a case in which the trustee was in substance deciding a question that was assigned by the deed itself to an insurer cf chammas v harwood nominees pty ltd no 1 1993 7 anz ins cas 61175 secondly while both under the general law and under cl 31 of the trust deed the trustee had no duty to give reasons for a determination adverse to mr kowalski a failure to give reasons in circumstances where explanation might be called for is another matter as young j observed in maciejewski v telstra super pty ltd 1998 44 nswlr 601 at 604 in dealing with the suggestion that because a trustee is not bound to give any reasons therefore the matter is completely unreviewable nothing could be further from the truth indeed whilst trustees do not have to give reasons in a case where a plaintiff puts forward a prima facie case that the trustees discretion has miscarried the absence of reasons and the absence of any evidence before the court as to what happened will tend to make that prima facie case a virtual certainty this view has been endorsed in many subsequent cases see baker v local government superannuation scheme pty ltd hay v total risk management pty ltd alcoa of australia retirement plan pty ltd v thompson 2002 116 fcr 139 at 37 flegeltaub v telstra super pty ltd see also butler lm reviewing trustees decisions the right to reasons 1999 7 aust property lj 251 thirdly as the trustee has considered mr kowalskis entitlement to a tpd benefit on a number of occasions and has decided against it an issue that presently arises is whether if at all it is obliged to reconsider that matter and if so in what circumstances these issues have helpfully been considered by the full court of western australia in tonkin v western mining corporation ltd 1998 10 anz ins cases 61397 and in a context not dissimilar from the present in a judgment endorsed by the other members of the court franklyn j made observations which though lengthy are presently relevant in several respects at 74270 in my view having regard to the terms of the deed and the relevant definition there is no obligation on the trustee on an application for the tpd benefit supported by evidence inadequate to give rise to the necessary opinion to seek out on its own initiative evidence for its consideration and so strain to obtain evidence relevant to the formation of the necessary opinion thereby attempting to bring within the definition a member not otherwise within its terms it may however in the exercise of its fiduciary duty and as a matter of discretion if it considers it appropriate seek and obtain additional medical evidence it may also as a matter of discretion require medical evidence to be submitted to it for the purposes of its consideration as trustee it is not an adversary either for or against an applicant for the benefit relevantly it has a duty only to act in accordance with the trust if it fails to perform the same the court will compel it to do so or do so for it it is not bound by any rules as to how it exercises a discretion conferred on it save such as it is obliged to comply with by the terms of the deed provided always that it must act honestly and in good faith on an informed view of whether or not to exercise its discretion and exercise the power with due consideration for the purpose for which it was conferred and for no ulterior purpose in the case of powers conferred on it and as to whether it should do or refrain from doing something it must exercise its judgment actively and honestly and act accordingly the court will not control a trustee in the exercise of its purely discretionary powers unless it is acting mala fide or has misconceived the nature of its discretion and acted upon that misconception when appointed to exercise a trust according to discretion a trustee is not bound to state reasons for any conclusion at which it may have arrived and on which it has acted but again the discretion must be exercised with an absence of indirect motive with honesty of intention and on a fair consideration of the issues the duty of the court generally is to see that the discretion of the trustee has been exercised in this manner and not to deal with the accuracy of the conclusion at which it may have arrived see jacobs law of trusts in australia 5 th ed p 372379 in my opinion it has at all times been open to the appellant to submit further medical evidence including the reports relied on in para 172a to the respondent for its consideration pursuant to the deed definition in respect of the claim for the tpd benefit in such case the respondent is bound to give them proper consideration no time limit is fixed or imposed by the deed for making application for the benefit or for the required consideration of medical evidence whether any statutory limitation might apply is not relevant to our consideration as no issue in that respect has been raised in the event of the respondent having considered medical evidence before it failing to form the necessary opinion there is nothing in the deed or rules to inhibit the appellant from providing for its further consideration further medical evidence relevant to the formation of that opinion there is nothing in the deed to lead to the conclusion that once having failed or refused to form the necessary opinion after consideration of the medical evidence then before it the respondent is under no obligation to consider further medical evidence relevant to the formation of that opinion indeed in my opinion on the proper construction of the deed and having regard to the fiduciary nature of the trustees obligations the respondent if requested to do so is bound to consider such evidence relevant to formation of the opinion as may from time to time be put before it consequently medical evidence whether coming into existence prior or subsequent to any particular failure or refusal to form the necessary opinion will necessarily have to be considered if made available by or on behalf of the applicant for that purpose i should note that for present purposes the respondents have conceded that beyond medical evidence if other material is provided to a trustee and is of such character as would lead a reasonable trustee to consider whether or not to reconsider its former opinion that material will have to be considered
14941,24,20,454,420,44100,on the other hand mandie j in australian securities and investments commission v plymin no 1 recognised correctly in my view that fryer v powell 159 flr 433 laid down only a general rule capable of variation according to particular circumstances see at 2003 vsc 123 2003 175 flr 124 at 255 at 535 in that case the loss and damage suffered by the creditors of a company in their claim against the directors needed to be adjusted beyond the amount of the unpaid debt because of an interim dividend distributed by the administrator under a scheme of arrangement of the company and for a further dividend which those creditors were likely to receive his honour added at 256 535 to the extent that any allowance for actual unexpected dividends is contrary to what was decided concerning the meaning of loss and damage in powell v fryer 2001 37 acsr 589 6023 sic i understand the plaintiff to have conceded that such allowance should be made and i tend with respect to think that the concession was correct in principle 34 i do not consider it is useful to import into the words of s 588m2 a requirement that the loss and damage referred to in s 588m1b and s 588m2 be characterised as liquidated or unliquidated clearly s 588m2 entitles the liquidator to recover the loss and damage whatever its character from the directors as a debt due to the company it is the debt due to the company which entitles the liquidator to prove in the bankruptcy of the directors although the wording of s 588m1b and c indicate that the loss and damage of the creditor or creditors need not equate to the amount of the debt or debts eg as mandie j identified in plymin 2003 vsc 123 175 flr 124 if there has been a distribution in the liquidation of the company to reduce that debt as at the date of the claim made in the bankruptcy by realisation of other assets of the company s 588m2 states that the loss and damage for the purposes of the claim against the directors be recoverable as a debt i note that hammerschlag j in buzzle operations pty ltd in liq v apple computer australia pty ltd 2007 nswsc 930 at 24 25 adopted that position albeit that the question was not apparently in contention before his honour

key features of the shape included 8226 its curved rather than flat sides 8226 a top portion with longitudinal fluting 8226 a central portion without fluting and a lower portion with fluting 8226 a flat base and a banded neck 47 the respondent imported and distributed colaflavoured confectionary the issues in suit were whether a threedimensional shape namely confectionary could be used as a mark to denote the origin of goods and whether such use infringed the appellants registered twodimensional trade mark at 20 the full court referred to the authorities relevant to the issue of use the question is whether the sign used indicates origin of goods in the user of the sign whether there is a connection in the course of trade between the goods and the user of the sign 48 at 31 the court said the question at this stage is not whether the respondent has used a sign so as to indicate a connection between it and the appellant it is whether the use indicates a connection between the confectionary and the respondent so it does not assist the respondent to demonstrate by reference to the packaging that the suggested connection is with efruti rather than coca cola 49 these passages reflect high court authority that a trade mark is a sign used to indicate origin of the goods in the user of that sign therefore in the ordinary case a court must first examine the use of the impugned mark and whether such use is trade mark use for the purposes of the act in cases such as the present this threshold issue should be determined before the court considers whether the two marks are substantially identical or deceptively similar the threshold issue only examines the impugned mark not the registered trade mark as was said in allfect at 32 at this stage the hypothesis is not that the appellant is trying to tell the consumer that the goods emanate from it but that the respondent is trying to tell the consumer that the goods emanate from the respondent 50 the full court in allfect held that the confectionary shape denoted use as a mark primarily because the confectionary had nondescriptive features in the shape of the mark the court said at 25 the confectionary has three features that are not descriptive of the goods they are the silhouette the fluting at the top and bottom and the label band it is not necessary for the respondent to adopt any of those features in order to inform consumers that its product is a cola flavoured sweet it could do so by using the cola colour the word cola and the shape of an ordinary straight walled bottle the silhouette fluting and band are striking features of the confectionary and are apt to distinguish it from the goods of other traders the primary function performed by these features is to distinguish the goods from others that is to use those features as a mark it is true as the respondent said that the fact that a feature is not descriptive of goods does not necessarily establish that it is used to distinguish or differentiate them but in the present case we are compelled to the conclusion that the nondescriptive features have been put there to make the goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive and thus to distinguish them from the goods of other traders emphasis added 51 the existence of striking features that were not descriptive of the confectionary was enough to indicate that it was used as a trade mark features that made the goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive had the capacity to distinguish the respondents goods from those of others 52 at 35 the court said that whether the respondent had used features of the confectionary as a trade mark was a matter for the court and was not governed by the absence of evidence that shopkeepers or customers concluded that the confectionary had a trade mark origin 61 the principles relevant to use of shape as a trade mark are now set out a a special shape which is the whole or part of goods may serve as a badge of origin however the shape must have a feature that is extra and distinct from the inherent form of the particular goods mayne at 67 remington at 16 and kenman kandy at 137 b nondescriptive features of a shape point towards a finding that such features are used for a trade mark purpose where features are striking trade mark use will more readily be found for example features that make goods more arresting of appearance and more attractive may distinguish the goods from those of others allfect at 25 c descriptive features like descriptive words make it more difficult to establish that those features distinguish the product for example the word cola or an ordinary straight walled bottle are descriptive features that would have limited trade mark significance allfect at 25 and mayne at 6162 d where the trade mark comprises a shape which involves a substantial functional element in the goods references to the shape are almost certainly to the nature of the goods themselves rather than use of the shape as a trade mark mayne at 63 for example evidence that a shape was previously patented will weigh against a finding that the shape serves as a badge of origin remington at 12 and mayne at 69 e if a shape or a feature of a shape is either concocted compared to the inherent form of the shaped goods or incidental to the subject matter of a patent it is unlikely to be a shape having any functional element this may point towards the shape being used as a trade mark kenman kandy at 162 and mayne at 69 f whether a person has used a shape or a feature of a shape as a trade mark is a matter for the court and cannot be governed by the absence of evidence on the point allfect at 35 g context is all important and will typically characterise the marks use as either trade mark use or not remington at 19 and mayne at 6062 63 at the other end of the spectrum are those features of a mark that are nondescriptive and nonfunctional they ordinarily make the shape more arresting of appearance and more attractive thus providing a means of distinguishing the goods from those of others allfect and remington show that nonfunctional features add something extra to the inherent form of the shape a concocted feature will typically be considered nonfunctional kenman kandy 71 in my view the photon and the cube shoe are used as trade marks where the features listed in 70 especially features a b d g and h are combined in the shape of a shoe the most important of these features for present purposes are the stitched yd label on both shoes the small rounded piece at the back of the cube shoe and the photons stripe running parallel to the base of the sole neither the cubes rounded piece nor the photons parallel strip is found on any of the shoes in evidence other than yds shoes mr vickery described the rounded piece as quite distinctive and not a feature commonly used in the shoe industry it can i think be considered a striking feature given its lack of commonality in the trade cf allfect at 25 72 features c e i and j in the list at 70 are either functional or in common use common features are like descriptive words 73 in my view the nonfunctional and nondescriptive features referred to in 71 overwhelm the functional features and common features referred to in 72 and give the cube and photon shoes a trade mark purpose 93 of the essential features the d is the most dominant feature of the shape mark significant weight and importance have been attached to that feature cf melbourne chinese press pty ltd v australian chinese newspapers pty ltd 2004 63 ipr 38 at 18 melbourne chinese press and allfect at 42 99 finally the context is all important in the present case the risk of confusion is mitigated by the circumstances in which the products are bought and sold 8226 purchasers of the shoes in suit are metroshoppers they are fashion conscious and discerning in their choices they are likely to be well informed about the products before purchasing them the steps involved in a purchase see 26 constitute a relatively lengthy process in the course of which a customer will become well informed about a product before making a purchase 8226 metroshoppers review product labels branding labels and logos are important features to this class of consumer their purchasing habits are refined and this lessens the chance of confusion 8226 yds shoes are sold only in yd stores the stores display yds signage and customers are well aware that they are in a yd store when purchasing an item 8226 the applicants and yds shoes are relatively expensive items compared with impulse products such as soft drinks and confectionary cf allfect at 41 purchasers of shoes generally tend to be discerning in their purchasing habits 8226 while it is not necessary for the applicants to lead evidence of actual deception cf crazy rons at 95 it is relevant that there was no such evidence
15765,37,15,326,39,13801,as far as the confidentiality agreement is concerned mr atta made the following submissions 1 the confidentiality agreement is void for uncertainty because it contains only an inclusive and not an exclusive definition of confidential information reading down or severance is not possible 2 the confidentiality agreement is a restraint on competition and void as against public policy because it purports to go beyond what may be lawfully protected mr atta referred to the decision in wright v gasweld pty ltd 1991 22 nswlr 317 again it is said that reading down or severance is not possible 3 as i understood it the submission was that even in the case of a confidentiality agreement which purports to define confidential information a party complaining of a breach of such an agreement must prove the information disclosed was in fact confidential reference was made to the requirements in equity for the protection of confidential information corrs pavey whiting and byrne v collector of customs 1987 14 fcr 434 at 443 per gummow j there is no evidence that the information was confidential and mr atta said that it was not confidential 4 the information disclosed to thq and cygnett was disclosed after mr atta had left the companys employ 5 there is no pleading of loss which could conceivably flow from a breach of the confidentiality agreement there is a claim for damages for breach of the confidentiality agreement but the only claim for loss and damage particularised in the statement of claim relates so it is said to the alleged breach of the implied term 170 i do not think the submission in paragraph 3 is right in the case referred to gummow j identified the elements of an equitable action for breach of confidence his honour was not dealing with a claim for breach of contract by disclosing confidential information as defined in the agreement there is nothing to suggest that subject to restraint of trade considerations the parties cannot define for themselves what is confidential they are not bound to protect no more than is already protected in equity 171 the submission in paragraph 4 cannot succeed because the confidentiality agreement specifically purports to apply to the period after mr atta has left the employ of futuretronics 172 the submission in paragraph 5 is essentially a pleading point which i would not allow mr atta to raise at this late stage or at least without giving futuretronics the opportunity to apply to further amend
10781,11,13,341,283,16936,an account of profits is an alternative remedy to damages see patents act 1990 s 1221 its purpose is not to compensate the patentee nor to punish the infringer but rather to prevent the unjust enrichment of the infringer at the expense of the patentee dart industries inc v deacutecor corporation pty ltd 1993 hca 54 1993 179 clr 101 at 110111 by reference to the judgment in dart v deacutecor 1993 hca 54 179 clr 101 and the cases there cited i have approached the calculation of the account of profits in this case on the following basis the infringers should account for the actual profit that they have gained from the infringement in calculating those profits it is appropriate to deduct costs directly attributable to selling and delivering infringing articles from the revenue made from such sales and deliveries it may be appropriate to deduct a proportion of general overhead costs such as plant equipment and managerial costs the deduction of such costs depends upon their being shown to have been attributable to the sales the onus for which demonstration is upon the infringers the account of profits is a discretionary remedy and the court may decline to grant the remedy in respect of profits made by the infringer during the period in which it was unaware of the applicants rights in this latter respect see in particular colbeam palmer v stock affiliates pty ltd 1968 hca 50 1968 122 clr 25 at 3336 and the patents act 1990 s 123 which is in the following terms 1 a court may refuse to award damages or to make an order for an account of profits in respect of an infringement of a patent if the defendant satisfies the court that at the date of the infringement the defendant was not aware and had no reason to believe that a patent for the invention existed 2 if patented products marked so as to indicate that they are patented in australia were sold or used in the patent area to a substantial extent before the date of the infringement the defendant is to be taken to have been aware of the existence of the patent unless the contrary is established 3 nothing in this section affects a courts power to grant relief by way of an injunction 78 there are two possible reasons why these money sums should be varied the first is one recognised by colbeam v palmer 1968 hca 50 122 clr 25 and the patents act s 123 the applicants solicitors first wrote to the respondents on 23 february 2005 informing them of the patent and requiring undertakings if one took 23 february 2005 as the date from which to calculate the profits there would be no claim against the second and third respondents the claim against the fourth respondent would be 25051 the claim against the first respondent would be the same 83089 and the claim against the sixth respondent would be the same 54 79 it is important to note that in colbeam v palmer 1968 hca 50 122 clr 25 it was stated that it was for the moving party to prove the unconscionability of the profits and therefore for the moving party that the defendant knew of the moving partys rights the patents act 1990 s 123 clearly involves discretion as to the question of refusing or discounting the award for the matters there identified also s 1232 makes plain that the defendant is to be taken to have been aware of the existence of the patent unless the contrary is shown if patented products marked so as to indicate they are patented in australia were sold or used in the patent area to a substantial extent before the date of the infringement 80 the evidence discloses that the applicants floor materials embodying the invention the subject of the patent had been distributed in australia since late 1997 the evidence discloses that the introduction of those panels revolutionised the trade in laminated flooring and greatly expanded the market for such flooring the evidence discloses that by 2003 when the relevant infringements commenced the applicants floor panels or imitations of them commanded over 75 of the australian market for laminated panels the evidence discloses that in 2003 the applicants australian agent and distributor sold about 312000 packs of the floor panels amounting to over 560000 square metres of flooring the evidence discloses that the panels were described as the industry standard in the october 2004 issue of a publication called flooring australia and new zealand the evidence discloses that the packs of the applicants panels were and have been since prior to 2003 clearly marked with the words patented technology with the individual panels bearing the number of the applicants european and united states patents the evidence discloses that since the grant of the australian patent on 23 november 2003 the relevant promotional material has also carried the number of the australian patent the evidence discloses that the fact that the applicants floor panels are patented has always been a prominent and important feature of promotions of the panels through sales representatives exhibitions and distribution of catalogues and brochures the evidence discloses that the website of the applicants australian agent and distributor has promoted the applicants relevant patent rights since at least early 2003 81 the huili respondents have not adduced any evidence in respect of the above matters they have not established that they were not aware of the applicants rights prior to the receipt of the letter of demand of 23 february 2005 a general assertion was made in a letter in march 2005 sent in response to the letter of demand but that statement has not been supported in these proceedings by any direct evidence further the first to fourth respondents did not plead any such lack of knowledge in their defence which was prepared when they were represented in the proceeding by solicitors and for a time by experienced patent counsel this was to be contrasted with the defence of the fifth respondent which was prepared earlier and which was available to the first to fourth respondents and which did raise the issue 82 in all the above circumstances i am satisfied that under s 123 i should not make any discount by reason of innocent infringement indeed if the matter were to be judged by colbeam v palmer 1968 hca 50 122 clr 25 i would be prepared to conclude based on inferences from all the above matters that the first to fourth and sixth respondents were aware of the patent of the applicant during the course of infringement my willingness to draw these inferences is in part based on the lack of any evidence brought forward on behalf of any of the first to fourth and sixth respondents of their ignorance prior to february 2005 83 also given the state of the documentation provided by the respondents to which i have earlier referred to the extent that there is a discretion within s 123 to deal with innocent infringement and to reduce the account of profits by the reason thereby i am not able to be confident that the respondents have so approached the conduct of this case that they should be entitled to any discount under s 123 this last consideration is a separate consideration from the matters of proof and evidence to which i have earlier referred 84 the second possible basis for reduction of the profits is the claim made by mr sun that the fifth respondent owes him or the first respondent sums of money as reflected in the crossclaim during the course of the hearing mr sun made no attempt to contest any aspect of the report of mr dunstan he concentrated his submissions on what he said was the injustice of being held liable for an account of profits in circumstances where he has not been paid for a significant amount of the supplies which he or his associated entities gave to the fifth respondent in this respect mr sun made reference to the detailed material and identified a series of invoices totalling 138901 they were as follows invoice amount ex gst s134 20505 s136 23275 s163 22959 s166 25362 4094 23396 s190 23404 85 this total differs from the 158000 referred to by mr sun in the hearing and also differs from the sum alleged in the cross claim 86 the huili respondents are liable to account for the profits made at the wholesale level of sales the fifth respondent was liable to account for its profit at the next level of sale retail sale the fifth respondent has accounted for those profits in the order which it submitted to by consent on 22 march 2007 there is no reason in principle why the applicant should not be entitled to both the wholesale profit and the retail profit if attributable as they are to the infringement

18401,86,36,309,269,15082,in relation to the fifth ground his honour found that the tribunal had taken into account the relevant factors and correctly applied the test in randhawa v minister for immigration local government and ethnic affairs 1994 52 fcr 437 randhawa 20 in addressing the final ground the federal magistrate found that the tribunal had considered the materials presented to it by the appellant his honour regarded the appellants claim that his feeling about the farm had been ignored as an attempt to challenge the factual findings and found that the tribunal had considered this aspect of the evidence his honour dismissed the application 21 the notice of appeal filed 30 october 2006 identified the following three grounds of appeal 1 his honour erred as the tribunal failed to take into all relevant material including united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr reports on internal relocation in colombia 2 his honour erred at 40 because the principles of the convention of the rights of the child have been incorporated into australia law through case law 3 his honour erred in finding that the tribunal did consider the situation in colombia as only one extract of country information it relied on related to internal relocation 22 before the first hearing date of 5 march 2007 the appellant filed written submissions attaching a proposed amended notice of appeal identifying one ground that ground was the federal magistrate erred in his finding at 46 that the tribunal correctly applied the test in randhawa that it was reasonable for the applicants to relocate within colombia particulars a the tribunal failed or failed adequately to determine whether an appropriate level of protection existed in any other part of colombia b lead tribunal failed to have regard or failed to have appropriate regard to the applicants personal circumstances and the practical realities in the event of such relocation 23 i will refer to this as the randhawa ground the ministers had also filed written submissions in relation to the proposed amended notice of appeal however the hearing was adjourned to allow the appellant to file and serve a proposed further amended notice of appeal raising a further ground and any evidence in support and for both parties to provide submissions counsel for the appellant indicated that the further ground concerned the tribunals failure to access a document published by the united nations high commission on refugees dated september 2002 counsel for the minister indicated that an amendment to raise the new ground would be opposed counsel for the appellant also made oral submissions on the randhawa ground 24 after the first hearing the appellant served on the tribunal a notice to admit facts the notice required the tribunal to admit for the purpose of these proceedings that on 4 december 2005 being the day before the tribunal decision was made the tribunal held a document entitled international protection considerations regarding columbian asylum seekers and refugees from the unhcr geneva september 2002 and later revised in september 2005 the appellant also served on the tribunal a notice to produce dated 6 march 2007 requiring the tribunal to produce a catalogue of all the material held by the tribunal relating to colombia 25 the tribunal responded in a letter dated 20 march 2007 from its solicitors it stated that the notice to produce was defective because it required production before the day of the final hearing contrary to o 33 rule 12 of the federal court rules it stated also that in any event the catalogue sought was not relevant to any issue in dispute and that the tribunal did not hold any such document it enclosed a notice to dispute facts by which the tribunal disputed that it held the held the document identified in the notice to admit facts it admitted that it held the following two documents 1 a document entitled international protection considerations regarding colombian asylumseekers and refugees unhcr geneva september 2002 the 2002 document 2 a document entitled international protection considerations regarding colombian asylumseekers and refugees unhcr geneva march 2005 the 2005 document 29 the proposed further amended notice of appeal contained two grounds the first was the randhawa ground the second ground was that the decision of the tribunal was void for jurisdictional error by reason of unreasonableness and constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction this ground was not raised before the federal magistrates court the claim in substance is that the tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by failing to have regard to particular country information relevant to the question of the reasonableness of relocation in colombia that information was the 2002 document and the 2005 document the appellants contended that those documents were readily available to the presiding member of the tribunal and were centrally relevant to the decision to be made the tribunals failure to obtain and have regard to the documents was said to have had the result that the tribunal exercised its power in an unreasonable manner and constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction according to law 30 in opposing the grant of leave to file the further amended notice of appeal the minister relied on the lack of a reasonable prospect of success of the ground the lack of an acceptable explanation as to why it had not been raised below and prejudice if the amendment was allowed 31 the 2002 document and the 2005 document were annexed to an affidavit of the appellants solicitor michaela byers sworn 16 april 2007 the minister did not oppose the affidavit and annexures being admitted into evidence for the purpose of determining the application for leave to amend however if leave was granted the minister opposed the admission of the affidavit into evidence on the ground that the appellant has failed to satisfy the requirements for adducing further evidence on appeal in particular it was submitted that no explanation had been provided as to why the fresh evidence could not with reasonable diligence have been adduced at first instance 41 i turn now to consider the randhawa ground while it received only limited attention by counsel for the parties particular b to that ground appears to me to be of some importance in randhawa the full court considered the appropriate test to be applied regarding the question of whether an applicant can be reasonably expected to relocate to another area in their country of nationality the relevant principles established by the full court in that case appear in the judgment of black cj at 442443 this further question whether the appellant could reasonably be expected to relocate to another area is an important one because notwithstanding that real protection from persecution may be available elsewhere within the country of nationality a persons fear of persecution in relation to that country will remain wellfounded with respect to the country as a whole if as a practical matter the part of the country in which protection is available is not reasonably accessible to that person in the context of refugee law the practical realities facing a person who claims to be a refugee must be carefully considered moreover the range of the realities that may need to be considered on the issue of the reasonableness of relocation extends beyond physical or financial barriers preventing an application for refugee status from reaching safety within the country of nationality and easily extends to circumstances such as those present in r v immigration appeal tribunal ex parte jonah 1985 imm ar 7 professor hathaway op cit at 34 expresses the position thus the internal protection principle should be restricted in its application for persons who can genuinely access domestic protection and for whom the reality of protection is meaningful in situations where for example financial logistical or other barriers prevent the claimant from reaching internal safety where the quality of internal protection fails to meet basic norms of civil political and socioeconomic human rights or where internal safety is otherwise illusory or unpredictable state accountability for the harm is established and refugee status is appropriately recognised emphasis in original text if it is not reasonable in the circumstances to expect a person who has a wellfounded fear of persecution in relation to the part of a country from which he or she has fled to relocate to another part of the country of nationality it may be said that in the relevant sense the persons fear of persecution in relation to that country as a whole is wellfounded once the question of relocation had been raised for the delegates consideration she was of course obliged to give that aspect of the matter proper consideration in the present case the applicant raised several issues all of which were dealt with by the decisionmaker if the appellant had raised other impediments to relocation the decisionmaker would have needed to consider 42 the observations of black cj in randhawa with whom whitlam j agreed reinforced by those of gleeson cj hayne and heydon jj in minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v respondents s1522003 2004 hca 18 2004 222 clr 1 at 19 establish that an applicant must establish that he or she cannot reasonably be expected to relocate to another area of their country of nationality yet the difficulties faced by an applicant in demonstrating that there is no other area to which they can reasonably be expected to relocate are often formidable there are at least two main sources of difficulty firstly the issue of relocation is almost always raised by the tribunal not the applicant and raised at the hearing the significance of this is particularly acute in cases where the applicant is not represented before the tribunal although that is not the present case secondly the issue is necessarily speculative this second issue raises the importance of the tribunal properly evaluating what the asylum seeker says about relocating this issue requires consideration of not only whether a safe haven exists in another part of the country proper consideration must also be given to the issue of relocation as a practical matter by considering whether it would be reasonable to expect the person to relocate in view of all the practical realities facing that person 52 on one view the tribunals conclusion that it did not accept the appellants claim in this regard was no more than a finding of fact that was the approach of the federal magistrate but in substance it was significantly more it was not a finding about past events but a conclusion that it would be reasonable to expect the appellant to relocate within colombia without given any real consideration to the specific issue he had raised an assessment of whether it was reasonable in the circumstances to expect the appellant to relocate could not be made by merely pointing to the fact that the appellant had not been on the farm for some years because he is in australia and had not been doing farm work whilst in australia the test propounded by black cj in randhawa requires that the evaluation be proper realistic and fair and all the circumstances be taken into account in my opinion the tribunal misunderstood the content of the principle propounded in randhawa did not apply it and thereby fell into jurisdictional error 53 the appeal should be allowed with costs the tribunals decision

3616,56,13,146,80,22363,the applicants relied on dao v australian postal commission 1987 hca 13 1987 162 clr 317 section 421 of the postal services act 1975 cth gave the commission power to appoint persons as officers for the purposes of the act section 422 provided that a person should not be appointed unless the commission was satisfied after the person had undergone a medical examination required by the commission as to his health and physical fitness and that he possessed such educational qualifications or met such other requirements if any as were required by the commission the commission dismissed ms dao and the other appellant from temporary employment and refused them permanent employment because in their medical examinations they failed to attain a specified minimum body weight determined by reference to their height and sex according to a scale prepared and used by the commonwealth department of health the commission determined on this basis that they did not possess the standard of physical fitness required the appellants complained before the new south wales equal opportunity tribunal that they had been discriminated against on the ground of their sex contrary to s 251 of the antidiscrimination act 1977 nsw the high court held that the ss 25 and 113 of the state act which empowered the tribunal to award damages and reinstatement would result in a clear usurpation of the responsibility resting on the commission under the commonwealth act and were clearly in collision with s 42 and must therefore by force of s 109 of the constitution give way at 335 their honours cited the statement of mason j in ansett transport industries operations pty ltd v wardley 1980 hca 8 1980 142 clr 237 at 260 if according to the true construction of the commonwealth law the right is absolute then inevitably follows that the right is intended to prevail to the exclusion of any other law a state law which takes away the right is inconsistent because it is in conflict with the absolute right and because the commonwealth law relevantly occupies the field so also with a commonwealth law that grants a permission by way of positive authority the commonwealth legislative intention which sustains the conclusion that the permission is granted by way of positive authority also sustains the conclusion that the positive authority was to take effect to the exclusion of any other law again it produces inconsistency on both grounds cf airlines of new south wales pty ltd v new south wales 1965 hca 3 1965 113 clr 54 where the permission for which commonwealth law provided was neither absolute nor comprehensive at p260 99 if the present case were concerned with a complaint under the antidiscrimination act about the discharge of a cadet under reg 14 2 a b or c it might be said that there was a direct collision between state and commonwealth law of the kind that occurred in dao however ms campbells case is not directed at any exercise of the power of discharge it does not trespass on that confined area of commonwealth statutory power by stipulating the grounds on which and the procedure by which cadets may be discharged the commonwealth did not evince an intention to exclude generally the operation of a tasmanian law outlawing discriminatory conduct in the areas of activity specified in s 221 and particularly education and training cf the discussion of wardley in dao at 336 100 in any case it is difficult to see how ms campbells complaint on her own behalf is affected by any provision of the air force act or the cadet forces regulations 
11537,49,19,414,122,8556,as to the notion of serious hardship above addressed in filsell the tribunal below drew attention to re wilson and minister for territories 1985 7 ald 225 where deputy president hall discussed at 229 the meaning of the similar notion of undue hardship in the context of exercise of the statutory discretion of the minister to discharge a liability for payment of rates on the ground of undue hardship being a meaning said by deputy president hall to connote something more severe than substantial hardship the tribunal below also discussed deputy president halls view that undue hardship means hardship that is excessive in the circumstances and that foreseeability and control constitute relevant considerations to the determination of hardship understandably deputy president hall further observed that neither expression undue hardship nor substantial hardship is susceptible to precise quantification the rationalisation of authorities undertaken in re wilson has provided assistance to later administrative decisions concerning this and analogous legislative provisions 22 as to the factor of fairness to other taxpayers identified in re wilson being a factor which i would acknowledge to be relevant to the tribunals approach in principle to decisionmaking the tribunal recorded also that mr milne had earned a high level of income in the past and was still earning income in a higher bracket moreover the tribunal found that mr milne had been able to acquire assets and to live reasonably well throughout his adverse business fortunes though the notions of high and higher are of course relative concepts and need to be applied with care having regard to all conceivably relevant circumstances in any event the tribunal accepted in favour of the commissioner the proposition that releasing mr milne would not be fair in the absence of special factors consistently with the previous tribunal decisions of ferguson and commissioner of taxation 2004 aata 779 and spicer and commissioner of taxation 2002 aata 960 the tribunal exemplifying ferguson as a case involving insufficient hardship for the availability of taxation relief in the present case moreover the tribunal emphasised as a socalled special factor in favour of mr milne for the grant of serious hardship relief his battle to continue work despite his very poor health and the need to support his dependant son until he finishes his schooling and obtains his hsc 54 in reaching that conclusion i have been unable to accept that the tribunal was bound to adopt and implement the approach to administrative review advocated by the commissioner inclusively by way of appraisal of any comparison of the value of mr milnes assets with the amount of his liabilities at any relevant point of time having regard to the reality of the extent of the financial hardship which would be likely to attend an exaction of the amount required to satisfy mr milnes outstanding taxation indebtedness inclusive of accrued statutory interest changes which if not leaving mr milne destitute without any means of support would have constituted nevertheless serious hardship in accordance with the text of the commissioners policy guidelines framed by tr 2440 and in the light of the approach undertaken specifically and by way of practical exemplification in re filsell and re wilson 
3070,39,13,490,99,49391,it was submitted that professor garnauts evidence was relevant to understand the mischief which the prrta act was intended to remedy evidence of that kind was said to have been relied upon in re dr ken michael am ex parte epic energy wa nominees pty ltd 2002 25 war 511 at 107 and visa international service association v reserve bank of australia 2003 fca 977 2003 131 fcr 300 at 665 the evidence of the two experts was said to be informative and of assistance to the court in coming to a conclusion whether the hedging losses are covered by the words in relation to and in understanding what constitutes carrying on or providing the operations facilities and other things comprising the project in summary it was said that professor garnauts evidence demonstrates the economic and commercial reality of treating the hedge expenses as being in relation to the sale of petroleum or in carrying on the relevant operations against that background the evidence which it is sought to elicit from professor garnaut does not go to the meaning of any particular word or words in the prrta act the term economic rent appears nowhere in the act nor does the term resources rent tax save for the title to the act in particular the act does not contain any explicitly economic terms whose application to a particular case would be assisted by economic evidence by explicitly economic terms i mean words such as market and competition which appear in pt iv of the trade practices act 1974 cth in proceedings under pt iv of that act the evidence of economists may be relied upon to aid in the identification of the relevant market and judgments about the effects historic or predictive of particular conduct on competition in a market 53 re michael concerned the application of statutory and gas access code provisions to the determination of an access tariff for a gas pipeline parker j malcolm cj and anderson j agreeing referred to some of the terms of the relevant act and the code as being in common use in that field of economics which is concerned with competition policy or more particularly with the regulation of essential infrastructure at 107 his honour observed that these words or phrases conveyed a meaning to those familiar with the field of economics differing from that which the words themselves would suggest in ordinary everyday usage he said at 107 as the subject matter is by nature conceptual there is no uniform accepted and certain meaning but there is a principle or theory the essential tenets of which are widely understood though there need not be uniform acceptance of them in my view expert evidence may relevantly and usefully inform the court as to this specialised usage of which the court would otherwise be unaware so that the court can determine whether the act and code is using particular words or phrases in their ordinary everyday usage or in the specialised usage among those versed in this field of economics importantly his honour continued at 107 further the expert evidence provides an appreciation of the nature and objectives of competition policy in the field of economics and in particular of the regulation of essential infrastructure so that the policy and objectives of the act can be discerned with a greater and more reliable appreciation of the possibilities in addition the potential relevance of some concepts and provisions in the act and code can be more readily understood in visa tamberlin j observed in relation to re michael and other cases involving admissibility of expert economic evidence at 665 the emphasis in these cases is on informing and assisting the court with a view to illuminating an understanding of the terms used in relation to the issues raised his honour also agreed with lindgren j in allstate life insurance co v australia and new zealand banking group ltd no 6 1996 64 fcr 79 that generally it is not for an expert to give evidence as to the application of a legislative provision as opposed to furnishing evidence from the viewpoint of an economist with respect to what factors can or should be taken into consideration or ignored it is also appropriate to note his honours prudential observation with which i agree that at 669 in ruling on the admissibility of the expert evidence at an early stage of the hearing i was conscious that there can be substantial difficulties particularly in relation to issues of relevance and appreciating the overall context against which to properly or fully consider admissibility the general approach which i took was to err on the side of admitting evidence which was on or close to the borderline on the basis that such evidence if admitted could be evaluated as to substance and weight in final submissions professor garnauts evidence assumes that the act is intended to tax economic rent as he explains that term the company relies upon various extrinsic materials antedating the passage of the act as indicative of that purpose assuming that purpose is made out then professor garnaut offers what amounts to the inference that the overall objective of the act is to generate revenue without distorting business decisions on the amount or composition of investment or production this identified purpose is relied upon to assist the court to decide in the first place whether the contentious hedging losses were expenses payable by woodside energy in relation to the sale of petroleum within the meaning of s 24a of the prrta act assuming that the hedging losses are properly to be called expenses the question reduces to whether they are expenses in relation to the sale the words in relation to and similar terms like in respect of or in connection with or just in have been considered in many cases and many contexts they denote a necessary connection between two subject matters which may be activities events persons or things the nature and closeness or remoteness of the connection depends upon context in workers compensation board qld v technical products proprietary limited 1988 hca 49 1988 165 clr 642 the term in respect of was said to have a wide meaning it gathers meaning from the context in which it appears and it is that context which will determine the matters to which it extends at 653654 per deane dawson and toohey jj the words in relation to have been described as a prepositional phrase which is indefinite and which subject to any contrary indication derived from its context or drafting history requires no more than a relationship whether direct or indirect between two subject matters ogrady v north queensland company limited 1990 hca 16 1990 169 clr 356 at 376 mchugh j the term is indefinite and will not generally apply to any relationship no matter how remote the extent of the relationship required will depend upon the context in which the words are used australian competition and consumer commission v maritime union of australia 2001 fca 1549 2001 114 fcr 472 at 482 hill j and authorities there cited two things may stand in relation to each other in a variety of ways the relationship may be spatial temporal or causal it may be a relationship of similarity or difference relationships between things in the law do not simply exist to await discovery they are defined by the common law or by legislation and their authoritative interpreters the criteria by which a statutory test of relationship is to be applied will have to be relevant to and serve the purposes of the statute the relationship between claimed expenses and the sale of petroleum products in s 24a of the prrta act cannot be the subject of a bright line definition covering all cases but it must lie within the bounds of relevance to the statutory purpose if that purpose can be explained or elucidated by reference to a recognised economic mechanism to which the act is intended to give effect then expert evidence about the operating principles of that mechanism can be received such evidence may not be material directly concerned with interpretation of provisions of the act as is extrinsic material received pursuant to s 15ab of the acts interpretation act nor can it justify any application of the act beyond the bounds set by its language but it may help to identify the purpose of the statute and thus inform the application of ambulatory terms in it such as in relation to in s 24a the preceding observations do not import any concluded view about whether the assumption on which professor garnaut will base his evidence is made out that will require a closer consideration of the terms of the act and the extrinsic materials relevant to its interpretation it is better done in the context of all the evidence including the extrinsic materials relied upon i am not prepared to rule professor garnauts evidence inadmissible i take it as evidence rather than as submission in that it purports to demonstrate that the economic mechanism to which the prrta act is said to give effect would treat hedging losses as expenses in the way for which woodside energy contends if some of his evidence trespasses into argument i will simply treat it as such i do not regard him as offering evidence on the ultimate issue even if that were a difficulty rather it proposes that a certain treatment of hedging losses would advance the purpose of the statute viewed in the light of the economic theory which underpins it i will therefore admit the evidence proposed to be called from professor garnaut ultimately this is a decision about relevance it may be that in the light of further evidence and argument his evidence will be shown to be based upon a false assumption if that is so then it may be that it will be rejected as irrelevant i am not prepared to find on the materials presently before me that the assumption upon which he advances his evidence has been falsified it seems to me to be at least arguably relevant and so will be admitted the admissibility of the evidence of professor walker it is well established that evidence of accounting practice may be admitted in revenue cases so that the court has the opportunity to characterise such things as receipts and payments for the purposes of the relevant statute by reference to accounting and commercial realities that is not to say that such evidence can displace the words of the statute nor does it involve the expert witness in interpreting the statute but where as in this case there are terms used of indefinite import such as in relation to incurred in relation to and made in carrying on operations then such evidence may properly inform their application having regard to the purpose of the statute and the context in which the provision appears in rowe and son pty ltd v commissioner of taxation 1970 hca 57 1971 124 clr 421 gibbs j referred to expert evidence that it was unusual to bring into the accounts of a trader making sales on terms only the payments received or receivable in the year in question and that to do so would not record the true position of the trading in connection with such evidence generally he said at 452 when the itaa gives no directions on the point the question when income is earned and the method of accounting to be adopted for the purpose of ascertaining the income depend upon business conceptions and the principles and practices of accountancy in bhp billiton professor walker gave evidence as to the proper accounting treatment to be adopted in the accounts of a corporation such as bhp billiton the passage from the judgment of gibbs j quoted above was quoted in the joint judgment of hill and heerey jj at 134 in ogilvy mather pty ltd v federal commissioner of taxation 1990 95 alr 663 hill j in the full court referred to

1953 88 clr 492 at 5067 nevertheless as the full court of this court pointed out in hooker rex pty ltd v fct 88 atc 4392 at 4399 the tendency of judicial decision has been to place increasing reliance

18517,26,29,149,122,33064,it is well established that before it can be said that a representation was prepared or obtained in contemplation of a proceeding it must be established that a proceeding was likely or reasonably probable see nikolaidis v legal services commissioner 2007 nswca 130 at 61 and the cases there mentioned the two questions which need to be determined for present purposes are first can it be said that legal proceedings were in contemplation and second if so were they in the contemplation of the person or persons who prepared or obtained the relevant representations for present purposes i am satisfied that representations contained in the documents which indicate that there were products purchased from retailers which did not contain amcs insert in the packaging ie products which were parallel imports are at least presently relevant representations as to the question whether legal proceedings were in contemplation at that time between amc and hamilton i am not satisfied on the material before me such was the case as i indicated above the evidence does not suggest there was a likelihood or reasonable probability of legal proceedings at the relevant time while the relationship of the parties at this time was undoubtedly tense they had by then been in a long term relationship spanning 14 years such references as were made in correspondence to hamiltons alleged responsibility to compensate amc either for dr lams success fee or for loss sustained by amc from parallel importing could at best only be properly treated as reflecting a negotiating process between the parties at this stage 12 when one turns to the contemplation of legal proceedings in hong kong the situation is quite different it is clear that from august 2002 as the investigation into parallel importing appeared to bear fruit in amcs eyes the prospect of taking proceedings against distributors and retailers was a very real one notwithstanding that amc obviously was wishing to resolve disputes without resort to legal proceedings and the correspondence reflects this it also makes it perfectly plain that litigation was contemplated it suggests that by early september proceedings were pending and on the evidence before me a writ had been issued by midoctober which coincidentally was the time at which the last group of documents in the bundle were referrable for this reason i am prepared to infer that so far as dr keung and dr lam were concerned legal proceedings throughout the time period covered by the business records in question were likely or reasonably probable against hong kong distributors andor retailers involved in alleged parallel importing

21236,66,27,197,133,1232,relation to the medical evidence the federal magistrate observed that the tribunal was not disbelieving of the applicants medical practitioner the tribunal was rather saying that whatever illness the applicant might have been suffering from had not been observed by it to prevent the applicant giving his evidence and said that this was not an error such as was found in fuduche v minister for immigration local government and ethnic affairs 1993 45 fcr 515 furthermore the federal magistrate noted that the selection and assessment of independent country information was a matter for the tribunal the federal magistrate rejected the submission that the tribunal had required independent corroboration regarding the appellants claims about his conversion to christianity and his asserted dissipation of funds after the purported withdrawal of financial support by the islamic group and was of the opinion that the tribunals finding that it was not readily believable that the appellants financial resources had all disappeared was unobjectionable and accorded with the facts as they stood the second aspect of this submission was that the tribunal had deprived itself of jurisdiction by imposing a requirement on the appellant that he be formally baptised in order to be at risk of persecution as an apostate from islam the federal magistrate observed that the tribunal did not at any stage in its reasons for decision assert that it was necessary for the applicant to have provided independent evidence of his conversion to christianity or that baptism was necessary for persecution to occur as to the claim of bias the federal magistrate read the transcript and listened to the audio recording of the hearing the federal magistrate said that the transcript did not show on its face either unfairness to the appellant or a predisposition amounting to a mind not open to argument and that the audio recording did not show any overt hostility on the part of the tribunal the federal magistrate was satisfied that the tribunal member was listening attentively to the appellant and that the appellants answers were coherent to the point and showed no undue signs of stress with the exception of the last paragraph of his evidence which did suggest a certain weariness and distress on the part of the appellant the federal magistrate found that the transcript and the audio recording did not reveal any improper conduct and that even if he accepted that the tribunal member had turned her back on the appellant and he made no such finding that conduct was at worst an unfortunate discourtesy but did not give rise to a finding of bias

appraisals and thought processes may show the relevance of the information in question and indicate what is required for compliance with s 424a1 it follows that information is not constituted by what the tribunal considers to be defects in evidence or a lack of evidentiary specificity secondly information may have relevance for any number of reasons compare szeeu at 263 per allsop j 25 i accept that the tribunals knowledge of the letter was information for the purposes of s 424a1 the contents of the letter included statements about the appellant and about the letterwriter the information was relevantly the knowledge that the letter communicated to the tribunal 26 the tribunal gave no weight to the statements in the letter about the appellants psychological condition because the letter did not communicate enough about the letterwriters qualifications according to its reasons the tribunals determination about the importance of the letter to its review was the product of its evaluation of the significance of this deficiency as already noted whilst the tribunals thought processes including appraisals and evaluations are not information they show why the information that they concern here the letter was relevant for s 424a1 purposes 33 obligations arise under s 424a1 in respect of information that the tribunal considers would be a part of the reason for affirming the decision under review in the present case for the reasons already noted the letter played a part in the tribunals reasons for its decision even if only a subsidiary part notwithstanding that a piece of information constitutes only a minor or subsidiary part of the tribunals reasons s 424a is attracted see szeeu at 252 per weinberg j and at 262 per allsop j and nbkt v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs 2006 fcafc 195 nbkt at 31 per young j with whom gyles and stone jj agreed the tribunal considered the letter in the form it took and put the statements about the appellants psychological condition which it contained out of reckoning because the letter did not state the letterwriters clinical qualifications the adverse credibility finding made after the tribunal had put this letter out of account was central to the tribunals decision the fact that the tribunals reasoning did not proceed in a straightline way is immaterial weinberg j explained in szeeu at 253 that the actual process by which a decision is reached is of course a complex matter it is not always as neat as the reasons themselves may suggest the reasoning may not proceed in a linear fashion and the tribunals reasons must of course be read as a whole 43 in other cases the tribunal has asked the applicant about such information which it has generally found in the departments file in the tribunals possession in cases of this kind the court has adopted no fixed view about the application of the exception on some occasions it has found that s 424a3b does not apply because the applicant was not to be taken as having given the information to the tribunal for the purposes of the review application see for example nazy v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs 2005 fca 744 at 39 42 per jacobson j in szbmi which appeal is reported with szeeu the applicant confirmed with the tribunal that an earlier statement as to flight information was true and correct this led the respondent to argue that the appellant in that case had adopted the flight information and given it to the tribunal for the purposes of its review moore j at 225 specifically rejected this submission commenting i do not accept that by adopting the statement at the hearing before the tribunal that information was transformed into information provided by the appellant in his application for review in my opinion the approach of jacobson j in nazy v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs was correct if the tribunal comes to know of what was said by an applicant at a point before any application for review was made and views what was said at that time as material to its assessment of what was later said by an applicant then the mere adoption of the earlier statement during the review process would not result in the knowledge and relevantly information in the present appeal being comprehended by s 424a3b different considerations could arise if it was clear the tribunal treated only the adoption of the earlier statement as the fact relevant to its consideration of the application in the review in those circumstances the fact of adoption would almost certainly constitute information provided by the applicant in the application on which the exclusion would operate 44 weinberg j agreed with moore j that the adoption of the earlier statement by the appellant during the hearing before the tribunal did not render it information provided by him in his application for review see szeeu at 252 allsop j did not consider the operation of the exception in s 424a3b in this context 45 as young j noted in nbkt at 55 the full courts approach in szeeu to issues of this kind must also take into account its treatment of a similar question in the appeal in szdxa also reported with szeeu the relevant information in szdxa was the fact that the appellant had a temporary business visa to australia moore j concluded that although the tribunal had acquired this information from sources other than the appellant the tribunal had discussed the fact with the appellant at the hearing and the appellant had affirmed that he had entered australia on a business visa in this circumstance moore j concluded at 242 that the information fell within 424a3b and weinberg j agreed at 254 observing at 255 that the adoption of an earlier statement at the hearing can bring that statement within the exception allsop j agreed at 268 with moore j in relation to szdxa the full court in nbkt reached a similar conclusion in relation to the information in

1087,87,15,92,61,49933,it is significant to recall that all parties needed to confront the principal question in the proceedings on the basis there existed only one previous decision of the court that of hamersley iron pty ltd v national competition council 1999 164 alr 203 hamersley which dealt with the interpretation of the term use of a production process within s 44b of the act and which involved a very similar factual scenario to the proceedings fortescues principal contention was that applying the marketable commodity test to the factual scenario as contended for by fortescue a marketable commodity was produced in bhpbios operations before the iron ore was railed to the port as an alternative contention fortescue sought to distinguish hamersley on a number of grounds 30 bhpbio had good legal grounds for its position and conducted itself in the litigation reasonably and appropriately nevertheless bhpbio was the losing party and fortescue would ordinarily be entitled to its costs however despite fortescues ultimate success in the proceedings i did not find in favour of fortescue on certain factual and legal issues or inquiries nevertheless i do not consider it appropriate in the circumstances to disentitle fortescue to its whole costs in the proceedings 31 the conduct of fortescue in this proceeding was neither inappropriate nor unreasonable fortescue structured its case primarily on the basis of the correctness of the decision in hamersley therefore it seems to me that seeking to apply the marketable commodity test as expounded in that decision was an entirely appropriate and reasonable approach further it seems to me that fortescue seeking in the alternative to distinguish the hamersley decision on a number of grounds was similarly appropriate and reasonable in addition i do not see any inappropriate or unreasonable behaviour on the part of fortescue in its approach to putting bhpbio to proof on factual matters or contentions the court accepted in essence the actual process and operations as contended for by bhpbio however the conclusions of the court were determined objectively and not by reference to bhpbios own subjective views or characterisations or by reference to the subjective views or characterisations of the witnesses called on behalf of bhpbio fortescue was entitled to test the evidence put forward by bhpbio especially in respect of such subjective views and characterisations 32 in hamersley the learned trial judge held the term production process meant a series of operations by which a marketable commodity is created or manufactured at 213 the test required as a question of fact and degree a consideration of the actual operation of the activities in question considered as a whole at 213 the evidence as to marketable commodity whilst it may be separately identified was all part of the material the court needed to consider in determining the actual operation of the activities in question accordingly it does not seem unreasonable for fortescue to have approached in the way it did the material placed before the court the principal question for determination in the proceedings was not a mere matter of statutory interpretation of the term the use of a production process that could be dealt with by demurrer rather the court was required to consider in detail the factual evidence of bhpbios operations and apply the construction of the term the use of a production process whether that construction be the one set out in hamersley or the construction for which the court ultimately found there does not seem to me to be any element of unreasonableness or inappropriateness in fortescue directing its evidence submissions and crossexamination to the application of that test to the facts of this case 33 this is not the end of the inquiry as i have indicated the exercise of the discretion to make an order as to costs is not just limited to a consideration of the reasonableness or appropriateness of the conduct of a party in connection with the proceedings it may also be appropriate to discount an order in favour of a successful litigant in circumstances where it has lost certain issues or inquiries which can clearly be treated as distinct and severable 34 at the outset i do not consider that the matters upon which fortescue was unsuccessful were relevantly distinct or severable although they can be identified rather the matters on which fortescue was unsuccessful were alternative arguments in support of the one principal question in the proceedings that is whether either of the relevant services was a service within the meaning of s 44b of the act the matters raised by fortescue were sufficiently linked to this principal question in the proceedings fortescue did not seek to raise a separate matter for determination by way of a positive defence 35 however to the extent the issues or inquiries upon which fortescue lost can be identified and even if they be relevantly distinct and severable in my view none of the matters sought to be addressed by fortescue were so disproportionate to the whole case or so lacked merit or so adversely impacted upon the economy and efficiency of the proceedings according to case management principles as to warrant an order to deprive fortescue of some or all of its costs as i have said i was required to consider in detail the factual evidence and apply that evidence to the construction of the term use of a production process which fortescue reasonably contested the ultimate ends of justice would not be served by fortescue not recovering its costs because of its failure on some identifiable or even distinct and severable issues or inquiries when those issues or inquiries needed to be canvassed as being material to the reaching of a decision

9986,40,19,157,150,36186,in the case before me the applicant is asking the court to confirm an interpretation of the definition of fringe benefit which has been previously applied in four cases decided by judges of the federal court and to find that that interpretation is applicable in the case now before me further the applicant is asking the court to require the commissioner to rule in accordance with that interpretation the foundation of this interpretation is in the judgment of kiefel j in essenbourne pty ltd v commissioner of taxation 2002 fca 1577 2002 atc 5201 2002 51 atr 629 where her honour held that the definition of fringe benefit as defined by subs 1361 fringe benefits tax assessment act 1986 cth fbtaa requires reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit said to have been provided in the absence of reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit the benefit provided is not a fringe benefit for the purposes of the fbtaa 5 i

commissioner is of the view that the principle as decided in essenbourne and subsequently applied is not correct he has made submissions to this effect referring to australian taxation office media release nat 0330 further in the explanation attached to the private ruling provided to the applicant the commissioner confirmed that his views as expressed in taxation ruling 19995 remained the ato position notwithstanding the decision in essenbourne the commissioner in the case before me is asking the court to reconsider the interpretation of fringe benefit articulated in essenbourne 7 this application and the position taken by the commissioner both practically in disallowing the applicants objection and legally in his submissions lead in my view to two key questions which require decision by this court 1 should this court apply the interpretation of fringe benefit as applied in essenbourne specifically that there will be no fringe benefit unless there is identification of particular employees in connection with the receipt of the benefit 2 if the court should apply that interpretation was a fringe benefit provided within the meaning of s 1361 fbtaa in the case before me 8 before going to those questions it is appropriate to consider the relevant history of this matter in particular 8226 details of the proposal the subject of the appeal 8226 question 1 in the application for the private ruling submitted by the applicant and other rulees 8226 the case of the applicant in submitting that the issue of shares in abc learning centres ltd abc public to the trustee of the carers share plan csp did not give rise to a fringe benefit in relation to either abc public or the rulee regional management companies rmcs and 8226 the reasons of the commissioner in making a ruling unfavourable to the applicant which forms the primary focus of this application 9 the factual background to this application and the arrangement proposed by the applicant are not in dispute in the sense that 8226 the facts were substantially detailed in appendix 4 to the application for private ruling submitted by harris black chartered accountants on 2 june 2005 on behalf of the list of rulees named in appendix 1 to that application the applicant in the case before me is one of those rulees and 8226 those facts were essentially reproduced in the outline of the relevant facts contained in a letter under the hand of mr paul duffus deputy commissioner of taxation on 30 june 2005 containing the private ruling produced by the australian taxation office in response to the application for private ruling 18 so far as is relevant for present purposes the case of the applicant is as follows 8226 the abc public shares were provided by abc public to the trustee of the csp abc public was not an associate of the rmcs whose employees potentially could receive a benefit 8226 the abc public shares were provided by the trustee of the csp to particular employees the trustee was also not an associate of those rmcs 8226 no employee had any entitlement to abc public shares unless and until he or she qualified for appointment and was appointed those shares by the trustee of the csp 8226 there was no sufficient or material link between the issue of shares by abc public to the trustee of the csp and the employment of any employee of an rmc instead the csp acted as a true incentive to the employees to remain in employment with an rmc because an employee could only benefit if and when the trustee of the csp exercised its discretion in his or her favour when the trustee exercised its discretion in an employees favour any benefit in the form of dividends or shares would be assessable income to the employee 8226 in order to fall within the definition of fringe benefit the relevant benefit must be in respect of the employment of the employee essenbourne in this case no specific employees were identified as being in receipt of benefits under the proposal and 8226 the proposal could properly be characterised as falling within the exclusionary principles in par ha of the definition of fringe benefit in s 1361 fbtaa namely that it was a benefit constituted by the acquisition by a person of a share or right under an employee share scheme within the meaning of div 13a of pt iii of the income tax assessment act 1936 such schemes are specifically excluded from being a fringe benefit by par ha of the definition 19 detailed reasons for the answer to question 1 were set out in a document entitled explanation this does not form part of the notice of private ruling this document was attached to the notice of private ruling authorisation number 53514 which was in turn sent by letter dated 30 june 2005 under the hand of mr duffus of the australian taxation office to harris black chartered accountants 20 in summary the reasons that the issue of abc public shares to the trustee of the csp were deemed by the commissioner to give rise to a fringe benefit in relation to the rulee rmcs as employers were as follows 8226 shares are considered to be property and therefore a benefit for the purposes of the fbtaa 8226 when abc public issued shares to the trustee abc public was considered to provide property to the trustee pursuant to s 154 fbtaa 8226 the trustee of the csp was considered to be an associate of an employee where the employee was capable of benefiting under the trust therefore when abc public issued shares to the trustee of a trust and an employee was capable of benefiting under that trust a benefit would be provided to an associate of the employee 8226 in considering whether one of the abc entities could be a relevant person for the purposes of either par e or par ea of the definition of fringe benefit there appears to have been some confusion in the explanation in the commissioners analysis with respect to whether an abc entity could be an arranger for the purposes of par e the commissioner refers to abc issuing shares to the trustee of a trust and abc intends to issue shares to the trustee for the benefit of the rmcs employees when the entity actually issuing the shares was abc public in the final analysis the commissioner was of the view that it was arguable that the entity issuing shares was not an arranger within the meaning of par e 8226 in relation to the possible operation of par ea however the commissioner was of the view that abc would be a person the provider if o the rmcs participated in or facilitated the issue of shares to the trustee and knew or ought to have known they were doing so or o the rmcs participated in facilitated or promoted the csp and knew or ought to have known they were doing so the commissioner stated in the explanation that if the rmcs were to provide this information to the trustee they would be participating in or facilitating the issue of shares to the trustee and participating in or facilitating the csp and would know or ought reasonably to know they were doing so where the information was provided to the trustee by abc the rmcs are still considered to be participating in or facilitating the issue of shares to the trustee and participating in or facilitating the csp because it is only as a result of their agreement with the abc under the licence agreement that abc is able to provide this information this reasoning was further explained by the commissioner in the letter of 13 september 2005 to harris black chartered accountants setting out the reasons for decision of the commissioner in finding against the applicant in relation to its notice of objection against private ruling the commissioner through mr duffus pointed out in that letter that 8226 abc also provided information to abc public for abc public to calculate the gifting of shares to the trustee 8226 abc only had that information to allow it to prepare the payrolls for the rmcs and 8226 the only way abc could lawfully pass on such information to abc public was with the participation or facilitation of the rmcs the commissioner was of the view that in these circumstances the rmcs would know or ought reasonably to know that the rmcs were doing so pursuant to par ea accordingly in the view of the commissioner it followed that for the purposes of par ea of the definition of fringe benefit abc was a person the provider 8226 the commissioner noted that fringe benefit in s 1361 fbtaa meant inter alia a benefit provided in respect of the employment of the employee in his view the csp operated as an employee incentive scheme providing rewards to rmc employees for services they provided as employees accordingly the issue of shares by abc public to the trustee of the csp was a product or incident of the employment of the rmc employees 8226 the reference in the definition of fringe benefit to a benefit being provided to an employee meant that a fringe benefit could arise notwithstanding that a benefit provided to a trust might not be provided in respect of a specific employee 8226 in any event the commissioner was of the view that the facts in this case were arguably distinguishable from those in essenbourne in particular the commissioner noted that cl 36 app 4 to the application for private ruling stated that the initial issue of ordinary shares by abc public would be calculated by reference to the number of employees who had signed an awa held positions as set out in that document and had served a certain fulltime period in that position at an abc centre the commissioner said that therefore it was arguable that the shares issued to the trustee of the csp were shares provided in respect of the employment of particular employees 21 in the explanation the commissioner continued to maintain the views expressed in tr 19995 in preference to the views of kiefel j in essenbourne tr 19995 explains the approach of the commissioner to circumstances where property is gifted to a trust and an employee who is a beneficiary of that trust is able to benefit from that gift as explained by par 1 of tr 19995 the ruling considers inter alia whether a payment by an employer of money which does not constitute salary or wages or an exempt benefit to the trustee of a trust or noncomplying superannuation fund is a fringe benefit and the value of that benefit the view was expressed in the explanation that the ruling applied to the circumstances of this case and that further for reasons outlined in pars 4549 of tr 19995 a fringe benefit could arise notwithstanding that a benefit provided to a trust was not provided in respect of a specific employee 22 paragraphs 4549 of the ruling are as follows 45 the definition of fringe benefit in subsection 1361 is in relation to an employee it is considered that there will be a fringe benefit notwithstanding the payment of the money to the trust is not in respect of a specific employee such a construction is the natural consequence of the use of the indefinite article an it is sufficient if the benefit is provided in relation to employees generally 46 alternatively where the contribution is not made in respect of a particular employee or employees the benefit will be provided in relation to each and every employee as the trust or noncomplying superannuation fund may be for the benefit of all employee 47 the foregoing construction of the definition of fringe benefit is supported by the fact that paragraph 1361hb specifically exempts from the definition a benefit constituted by the acquisition by a trust of money or other property where the sole activities of the trust are obtaining sharesin a companyof the employer and providing those shares to employees of the employer emphasis added 48 such an exclusion would be otiose if the definition of fringe benefit did not include benefits provided to an associate of the employees in respect of the employees generally 49 an alternative view relies on the reference to the employee in paragraph b of the definition of fringe benefit as outlined above we do not accept this view 23 by objection dated 14 july 2005 the applicant objected to the ruling of the commissioner in response to question 1 of the ruling application as i noted earlier in this judgment the commissioner disallowed the objection in a letter of 13 september 2005 containing the notice of decision on objection 24 an application was then filed with this court whereby the applicant appealed against the appealable objection decision 25 in answering this question it is helpful to consider 8226 relevant legislative provisions under the fbtaa 8226 the decisions and reasoning in essenbourne and subsequent cases and 8226 principles of precedent 33 whether the trustee in this case is an associate of the employees within the meaning of the legislation will be considered later in this judgment the cases essenbourne 34 as i have already noted the first issue involves consideration of fringe benefit as decided in essenbourne it is useful therefore to consider the case and the principle articulated by kiefel j currently in dispute 35 in essenbourne the employer was a family company which owned a motor dealership in queensland the three key employees were three sons of the marino family which controlled essenbourne pty ltd the sons received low salaries in keeping with the corporate strategy of coping with periods of business downturn and enabling surplus funds to be reinvested in profitable years in light of the low salaries a superannuation fund an employee share fund and an employee incentive trust were established to provide benefits primarily to the three employees of essenbourne pty ltd who were family members this was in addition to the salaries they received and in order to retain their services 36 various capital contributions were made to each entity however the critical payment for present purposes was a contribution by essenbourne pty ltd of 252 000 to the employer incentive trust on 30 june 1997 this sum was calculated on the advice of the solicitor of essenbourne pty ltd and was equivalent to the sum which could be contributed to the superannuation fund on the basis of the age of all members of the superannuation fund on the same day the three key employees were allotted each one third of the employee units in the trust ie 84000 units each the employees were not required to pay for those units 37 the trust deed of the employee incentive trust provided that the trust was to provide benefits and incentives to employees and that the employer essenbourne pty ltd was to make contributions for the benefit of its employees generally cl 51 further the deed allowed the trustee to issue bonus units in respect of employee units to the holders of those units on such basis as the trustee with the consent of the employee might determine cl 101 41 as kiefel j noted the commissioner had not suggested the three brothers employees of essenbourne pty ltd were entitled to the trust money or the property in which the money was invested her honour also observed that under the trust the brothers had only the prospect of bonus units issuing par 50 42 while kiefel j accepted the commissioners proposition that it was not necessary that an employee be in receipt of a benefit where it has been provided to an associate of that employee the fact of provision of a benefit to an associate is not enough in itself to make that benefit a fringe benefit within the meaning of the fbtaa as her honour pointed out the difficulty in the commissioners approach is that it does not identify a benefit to a particular employee the statute may deem a benefit to be provided to an employee where it is provided to the employees trustee but this would not obviate the apparent necessity to identify the employee in question the definition of fringe benefit would appear to require the identification of the employee to whom the benefit is provided this is the principal contention of essenbourne par 51 emphasis added 43 her honour agreed with the contention of essenbourne pty ltd that the definition of fringe benefit required reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit said to be provided this requirement of the definition was not in kiefel js view satisfied in essenbourne given the nature of the contest before me it is important and relevant to set out her honours reasoning on this point 54 in my view essenbourne is correct in its contention that the definition of fringe benefit requires reference to a particular employee in connexion with the benefit said to have been provided this is reflected in the references to a benefit being provided to the employee or to an associate of the employee and to the benefit being provided in respect of the employment of the employee emphasis added the latter reference in particular can only be to a particular persons employment the commissioner submitted that the reference to an employee in the definition should be read as employees in the case of certain benefits as s 23 acts interpretation act 1901 cth would permit in my view the assessment act requires that the particular employee be identified in connexion with the benefit it is their employment which after all provides the necessary link to the benefit see j amp g knowles amp associates pty ltd v fc of t 2000 fca 196 2000 96 fcr 402 the definition does not admit of a reference to a number of employees in connexion with the benefit the subject of the assessment 56 the link between the benefit and the employment of the employee is required to be sufficient or material j amp g knowles 409 410 it arises because of the words in respect of the employment a mere causal link with the employment of the employee will not be sufficient essenbourne submits that at least until the issue of bonus units there is not a sufficient connexion with the brothers employment it seems to me that the substantial link at this point is as between the payment and the deduction sought by essenbourne it is not necessary for me to further consider the point for in my view the payment by essenbourne to the trustee does not qualify as a fringe benefit as it is defined 44 accordingly on the facts of the case kiefel j held that the benefits provided were not fringe benefits walstern spotlight stores and caelli constructions 45 in each of the federal court decisions walstern spotlight stores and caelli constructions the learned judge followed and applied the principles decided by kiefel j in essenbourne 46 in walstern hill j decisively and unambiguously agreed with kiefel j in essenbourne on this issue his honour said at 22 as i have already noted i would as a matter of comity follow the decision of kiefel j in essenbourne unless the case was either distinguishable or i was of the view that the decision was clearly wrong on this point the case is not distinguishable further far from being of the view that her honour was clearly wrong i am of the view that her honour was clearly right the definition of fringe benefit in s 1361 of the fbta act makes clear the importance of identification of the employee the benefit itself is one which is said to be in relation to an employee the benefit is required to have been provided to the employee or associate of the employee and is required to be in respect of the employment of the employee the definition of property fringe benefit if that is the kind of benefit relied upon requires relevantly provision of property to a particular person there referred to as the recipient the valuation formula relevantly here requires that there be a benefit provided to a person in respect of the employment of an employee any contribution made by an individual employee is taken into account in determining the taxable value of the benefit although not relevant in the present case the exclusion of a benefit otherwise deductible to an employee contemplates taking into account the specific circumstances of the employee himself or herself it is not surprising that the legislation requires a link between the benefit and a particular employee or associate of a particular employee because historically the purpose of the fringe benefits tax act 1986 cth is to provide a specific means of taxing benefits which are a substitute for income to an employee and in respect of which the provisions of the 1936 act and particular s 26e were thought to be defective income tax is a tax upon the taxable income of a particular employee while fringe benefits tax is a tax for which an employer is made liable and is payable at the maximum personal income tax rate the theory of fringe benefits tax legislation is that it operates as a final withholding tax payable by the employer on amounts that essentially are or would be income of the employee 48 finally in caelli constructions kenny j assumed that essenbourne correctly stated the law and applied the principle to the facts of the case par 61 49 as i have already noted in walstern at fca par 87 per hill j and caelli constructions at fca par 61 per kenny j their honours stated their views that the decision of kiefel j in essenbourne was correct and stated the law merkel j in spotlight stores did not need to discuss the essenbourne case in great detail however his honour observed that he proposed to follow essenbourne and walstern as notwithstanding the submissions of the commissioner in spotlight stores his honour was not satisfied that those decisions were clearly wrong at fca par 121 hill j in walstern had also indicated that as a matter of comity he would have followed the decision of kiefel j in essenbourne unless he had formed the view either it was distinguishable or that the decision was clearly wrong neither of which was the case at par 87 52 accordingly in my view it would be appropriate to follow the principle articulated in essenbourne and followed by three other judges of the federal court before me unless in my view the principle is clearly wrong or the facts before me are distinguishable 53 notwithstanding powerful submissions by the commissioner i am not satisfied that the principle articulated by kiefel j in essenbourne is clearly wrong with respect there is little to add to the reasons provided by kiefel j in essenbourne or hill j in walstern which have been repeated in this judgment i agree with the four judges in essenbourne walstern spotlight stores and caelli constructions that the identification of particular employees is a requisite element in the application of the definition of fringe benefit under the fbtaa like the judges in walstern spotlight stores and caelli constructions i propose to follow the essenbourne decision and to the extent it is applicable to the facts of the case before me apply it 55 as i take the view that i should apply the interpretation of fringe benefit as applied in essenbourne it is necessary to consider whether the facts of the case before me are distinguishable in such a fashion that the principle is not applicable so far as is relevant in the context of this case the question is whether the abc public shares which are the benefits in question have been provided in respect of the employment of a particular employee or employees 58 if as the applicant contends the employees are not identified with sufficient particularity in my view the question of the benefit being in respect of their employment does not arise as kiefel j pointed out in essenbourne it is their employment which after all provides the necessary link to the benefit see j amp g knowles amp associates pty ltd v commissioner of taxation 2000 fca 196 2000 96 fcr 402 59 the commissioner has submitted that the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in essenbourne and that if it was necessary to establish that the provision of benefits was in respect of particular employees this was the case the commissioner has submitted in summary 8226 beneficiaries were identifiable precisely from the terms of the csp deed in particular clause 11 which states beneficiary means at any time any employee of an employer rmc who a is registered as a party to an australian workplace agreement with an employer rmc and b holds the position of assistant group leader director or regional manager with an employer rmc other than an excluded person 8226 the employment plainly is the explanation for the provision of the benefit in the form of the abc public shares in respect of employees who are beneficiaries under the csp deed this was clearly described in the application for the private ruling 8226 the selection criteria are incorporated into the terms of the csp deed and the csp deed requires the trustee to have regard to those criteria in exercising its power of appointment 8226 the benefit is provided by abc public as the arranger within the meaning of par e of the definition of fringe benefit in s 1361 fbtaa the commissioner submits that arrangement is defined in very broad terms by s 1361 fbtaa and the context for the proposed plan as outlined in the ruling application evidences that the issue of the shares is made under an arrangement between abc public and the relevant rmcs notwithstanding the particular facts relied on by the applicant and 8226 in the alternative the benefit is provided by abc public within the meaning of subpara ea on the basis that there is participation andor facilitation by the rmcs in the provision of the share issue to their employees and knowledge by the rmcs or they ought reasonably to know that they are doing so 60 in my view the issue of whether a benefit has been provided by abc public as the arranger within subpara e of the definition of fringe benefit in s 1361 fbtaa or provided by abc public within the meaning of subpara ea of that definition does not arise because in my view the benefits provided in this case were not in respect of the employment of the employee 61 it is instructive to compare the proposal before me the rights of the employees who are potential beneficiaries under the csp deed and the extent to which they are identified with the facts in essenbourne indeed the interpretation of fringe benefit articulated by kiefel j in essenbourne appears even more relevant to the facts in this case before me than it was in essenbourne in my view the applicants case before me is stronger than it was before her honour 62 relevant aspects of the arrangement in this case include 8226 the benefits in question namely the shares in abc public were provided by abc public which notwithstanding that was the holding company of the statutory licensee was not in any relationship with the employees who would receive the shares which are alleged to constitute the fringe benefit the provider of the benefits was therefore more remote from the employees than was the case in essenbourne where the entity which contributed some of the capital to the fund was the employer of potential beneficiaries 8226 the trustee of the csp under the csp deed was an independent professional trustee this can be compared with for example the trustee in essenbourne where the trustee was a corporate entity of which potential beneficiaries were directors 8226 in the case before me the potential beneficiaries were defined in the csp deed as rmc employees who satisfied various criteria the relationship between the provider of the shares abc public the regional managers and the rmcs was within the framework of a franchise structure importantly any future employees of existing rmcs or of future rmcs which later came into existence and entered an arrangement with abc public could also potentially qualify as beneficiaries of the csp the arrangement in this case did not involve potential provision for family members associated with the employer company as was the case in essenbourne 8226 the csp was a discretionary trust with the trustee vested with powers to appoint income and capital of the trust fund among the beneficiaries on such terms and in such proportions as it saw fit this is clear from cl 33 and cl 44 of the csp deed although the trustee was required by cl 34 and cl 45 of the csp deed to act reasonably and to have regard to the selection criteria provided in the csp deed in my view this did not override the discretionary powers of the trustee the position of the trustee was reinforced by cl 87 of the csp deed which provided that every trust power authority and discretion of the trustee was absolute and uncontrolled this was similar to essenbourne where the trust deed provided for the employer to make contributions for the benefit of its employees generally and employees were entitled to subscribe for employee units however distributions of income to employee unit holders was determined from time to time by the trustee further in essenbourne employees were not entitled to receive bonus units unless certain conditions had been satisfied including periods of time as full time employees of essenbourne pty ltd 8226 although the calculation of the initial issue of shares by abc public to the trustee of the csp may have been by reference to the total number of employees of the applicant and the other rmcs at that time 8226 clearly no immediate benefit could be provided in respect of future employees of the rmcs who were nonetheless future potential beneficiaries 8226 the identification by the trustee of employees who satisfied the selection criteria to the extent that the trustee was required to distribute trust property to those employees as already discussed was an event to take place after initial issue which meant that at the time the contribution was to be made to the trustee no identified rmc employees were beneficiaries of the csp 8226 it is also feasible that additional rmc employees could become parties to new awas without further shares necessarily being issued by abc public to the trustee and 8226 on the facts it would also be possible for shares to be issued to the trustee in batches for employees generally without reference to particular employees 63 as counsel for the applicant submitted a far stronger connection existed between the contributions made for the employees and each employees employment in essenbourne than existed between the proposed share issue by abc public and any particular rmc employees employment 75 the applicant has also submitted that the commissioner was wrong to decide that he was not bound by previous decisions of the federal court following and including essenbourne on the facts of the case before me it is unnecessary for me to consider this issue the court orders that 1 the appeal against the appealable objection decision made by the commissioner of taxation under s 14zy of the taxation administration act 1953 cth to disallow in full the applicants taxation objection against the private ruling issued to the applicant for the fbt years ended 31 march 2006 to 31 march 2011 be allowed 2 the commissioners decision be set aside and substituted with the decision that the applicants taxation objection be allowed in full 3 the objection decision should have been as follows a the correct response to question 1 of the ruling application is that the proposed issue of shares by abc learning centres limited to the trustee of the carers share plan will not give rise to a fringe benefit in relation to the rulee rmcs including the applicant and b the ruling should be amended accordingly 4 the respondent pay the applicants costs on the basis provided for in the test case funding deed 5 in the event of a dispute between the parties as to the amount of the costs payable under the test case funding deed then the applicant shall pursuant to the federal court rules be entitled to costs ascertained in accordance with the test case funding deed and such costs can be taxed accordingly i certify that the

11092,64,30,415,332,38284,i do not discount the possibility that mr coulson asked mr hem to resign i rather think that something along those lines was suggested having accused him of theft it would not be surprising had mr coulson asked mr hem to resign by the time of the conversation the illwill between the two was significant if mr hem had been asked to resign to avoid a dismissal that would be equivalent to an actual dismissal in sheffield oxford controls co ltd 1979 icr 396 in delivering the judgment of the employment appeal tribunal arnold j said at 402 it is plain we think that there must exist a principle exemplified by the four cases to which we have referred that where an employee resigns and that resignation is determined upon him because he prefers to resign rather than be dismissed the alternative having been expressed to him by the employer in the terms of a threat that if he does not resign he will be dismissed the mechanics of the resignation do not cause that to be other than a dismissal the cases do not in terms go further than that we find the principle to be one of causation in cases such as that which we have just hypothesised and those reported the causation is the threat it is the existence of the threat which causes the employee to be willing to sign and to sign a resignation letter or be willing to give and to give the oral resignation but where that willingness is brought about by other considerations and the actual causation of the resignation is no longer the threat which has been made but is the state of mind of the resigning employee that he is willing and content to resign on the terms which he has negotiated and which are satisfactory to him then we think there is no room for the principle to be derived from the decided cases 20 in the end it is not necessary for me to rule on any of the disputed aspects of the conversation between mr hem and mr coulson the reason is that it is not in dispute that during the discussion mr hem was accused of being a thief in the absence of any justification and none was proffered that accusation constitutes what in some cases is referred to as a constructive dismissal

23848,35,17,426,308,8953,the commission also points to hudson v entsch 2005 fca 557 where dowsett j considered mr hudsons opposition to a costs order being made against him on the basis that inter alia the matter involved a significant question of public interest his honour held that that submission was the most significant and meritorious of mr hudsons arguments at 5 but that there is great potential danger in allowing individual members of the public to decide that particular issues are of public interest if that means that others must pay for the ensuing litigation an individual should not be encouraged to think that he or she can litigate without the risk of an order for costs in the event that he or she is unsuccessful merely because he or she considers that there is some aspect of public interest to be vindicated in the litigation the question is whether the first respondent or the applicant should bear the first respondents costs of these proceedings the applicant started the proceedings the first respondent had no choice in the matter and resisted them i consider that the better outcome is that the applicant pay those costs 14 mr smith does not rely solely on the question of public interest in relation to costs however the commission submits that as in entsch mr smith started the proceedings and the commission had no choice but to contest them accordingly the commission says the court should make an order that mr smith pay its costs 15 in response mr smith submits that the evidence before the tribunal which was also requested by discovery in his petition will show that it was the commission that caused my allegation and petition 
14672,24,18,32,4,34655,his honours reasons reflect the following observations concerning his honours assessment of the evidence before him and the legal issues a the applicant applied for the registered design on 24 december 2001 the registered design was granted on 27 may 2003 and since september 2004 midamarine has through arrangements with a licensee britz innovation pty ltd britz innovation and a related company kalinin pty ltd kalinin a company trading as britz marketing been selling an inflatable surfcraft described as the wavestar the applicant also sells another surfcraft article described as the surfster b the applicant contends that the wavestar is an embodiment of the registered design c in june 2005 mr russell joel binkin mr binkin an associate of the applicant provided a sample of the wavestar to mr corrick and endeavoured to persuade him that he should licence the design of the wavestar from the applicant mr corrick was provided with artwork which came from the applicant i am satisfied that the sample of the wavestar and the artwork contained clear notification of a registered design and the artwork and sample contained the warning which presently appears on the physical exhibit of the wavestar it is to be expected i would have thought that there was copyright in somebody in that formulation of the warning 6 d after the meeting and the supply of the sample and artwork mr corrick indicated he was not interested in pursuing a licence for the product 7 e in january 2006 midamarine and britz marketing entered into an exclusive distributorship in relation to the wavestar surfcraft in february 2006 mr corrick commenced negotiations with the national rugby league nrl and the australian football league afl to use the trade marks of nrl and afl sporting teams on surfcraft or surf mats f on 8 september 2006 a director of midamarine mr michael arenson learnt that dmc was supplying a surfcraft article to amart all sports which was said by mr arenson to be strikingly similar to the wavestar g on 22 september 2006 mr arenson saw a reproduction of the dmc article mr arenson spoke to mr corrick and wrote a letter to him on 24 september 2006 drawing his attention to the similarities in the design features between the wavestar article and the dmc article mr arenson drew mr corricks attention to the fact that the warning label endorsed on the dmc article was a direct copy of the warning notice on the wavestar article in particular mr arenson drew mr corricks attention to the reproduction on the dmc article of the claim the shape of this inflated product is a registered design h on 27 september 2006 the solicitors for dmc applied to register a design of a surfcraft in the name of dmc and in that application mr corrick was described as the designer his honour observed that no documents supporting his design exist for the good reason that in fact the dmc product is a direct and complete copy of the wavestar 11 i his honour noted it is now conceded that the dmc surf mat is indeed a copy and a deliberate copy of the wavestar this in my view had to be so the visual comparison leads to that conclusion the fact that the wavestar was left with mr corrick the comparison of the two and the identity of the words used in the warning on the back of the dmc surf mat and in particular the shape of this inflatable product is a registered design lead inevitably to the conclusion that the dmc product is a direct copy of the wavestar 12 the words on the wavestar reflect the contention by mr arenson that the wavestar is an embodiment of the registered design the presence of those words on the dmc product is in my opinion damning evidence of copying by dmc of the wavestar 13 j counsel for dmc contended that the wavestar is not an embodiment of the registered design and in any event the registered design is invalid as to the latter question his honour concluded that for interlocutory purposes the applicant is to be treated as the owner of a valid registered design having regard to differences in the features of shape reflected in the examples of prior art indeed the attack on the validity of the registered design is seriously undermined by dmcs own application for registration of the design of the dmc product which application is tainted with dishonesty and fraudulent claims i accept that it has been acknowledged that the application will be withdrawn or otherwise expunged 16 l his honour addressed midamarines contention that dmc had applied the registered design or a fraudulent or obvious imitation of the registered design to articles sold and offered for sale by dmc at 23 the features of shape configuration pattern or ornamentation contained within the registered design capable of being judged by the eye are identified by his honour at 24 his honour observes i have inspected the inflated dmc product and compared it with the registered design the inflated dmc product possesses each of the features identified in the applicants written submissions those identified at 23 with the exception that the handles do not protrude from the top of the surf mat as depicted in the registered design the handles on the wavestar also do not protrude from the top of the surf mat as depicted in the registered design his honour concluded that for present purposes being the interlocutory purposes i am satisfied that to the eye the shape of the dmc product is substantially the same as that of the registered design it is in my opinion strongly arguable that the design which has been applied to the dmc product is an obvious imitation of the registered design that is in the words of the test in malleys malleys ltd v j w tomlin pty limited 196162 35 aljr 352 to be found at p 354 of the report not the same but a copy apparent to the eye notwithstanding slight differences 27 m his honour observed that even if the design applied to the dmc article is not an obvious imitation of the registered design the test for fraudulent imitation is even more strongly arguable 28 his honour identified the tests approved by the high court in polyaire pty ltd v kaire pty ltd amp ors 2005 hca 32 2005 221 clr 287 and the high courts approval of the observations of lehane j in koninklijke philips electronics nv amp anor v remington products australia pty ltd 1999 fca 816 1999 91 fcr 167 his honour concluded i am satisfied that there is a strongly arguable case of fraudulent imitation it seems inevitable that if the wavestar is an embodiment of the registered design then the dmc product is a fraudulent imitation the design of the wavestar and the dmc product is almost identical it could not have been independently created it is now admitted that the dmc product is a copy of the wavestar 31 so also is the embarrassing identity of the direct words of the warning label including the imprinting of the words the shape of this inflatable product is a registered design n at 33 his honour said this it is not denied that mr corrick was supplied with a sample of the wavestar surf mat and had discussed obtaining a licence of the design it seems plain that there is a strongly arguable case of obvious imitation or fraudulent imitation of the registered design o on the question of the balance of convenience his honour considered the observations of the high court in beecham group limited v bristol laboratories pty limited 1968 hca 1 196768 118 clr 618 at 625 and the principles affirmed by the high court in australian broadcasting corporation v oneill 2006 hca 46 and weighed in the balance the implications arising out of a consideration that dmc had in the face of warnings from midamarine and with eyes wide open embarked upon a course of importing selling and offering for sale articles to which a fraudulent or obvious imitation of the registered design had been applied at 39 his honour said this in my judgment the balance of convenience strongly favours the grant of the injunction sought the chronology of events and in particular the history of the design of the dmc product that is to say no design but a direct copy indicates that the respondents have decided to import and distribute the dmc product with their eyes open to the likely consequences of so doing p at 40 his honour further referred to submissions by counsel for midamarine and quoted this submission no reasonable trader having received the sales pitch from mr binkin in june 2005 for the wavestar could reasonably ignore the existence of the rights claimed in the design the words in the square brackets are explanatory words inserted into counsels submission by his honour q as to the question of damage accruing to midamarine his honour said this in this particular case the applicant is shown to be an established manufacturer and supplier of the wavestar surf mats it is strongly arguable that that product has the benefit of the protection of the registered design it has been creating a market for its product and supplying its product to distributors since 2004 35 earlier this year the applicant entered into an exclusive distributor arrangement with britz marketing i accept that its fortunes are tied to its ability to distribute its products via britz marketing the wavestar is now exclusively sold by britz marketing under the name wahu wavetube that surf mat is sold in an extensive range of shops including toyworld big w rebel sports target and toyrus mr britz says the wahu wavetube has been heavily promoted 36 since the first respondent dmc began in october 2006 to sell the dmc product amart all sports has ceased all sales of the wahu wavetube and has acquired instead the dmc product i accept that the inability to sell surf mats to the applicants design to amart has a significant impact on the ability of the applicant to make sales r on the question of an assessment of potential wider injury his honour concluded that there is a serious overstatement of those risks in the evidence on behalf of the applicant 38 his honour concluded that there was a deal of exaggeration in the injury inherent in the contentions of mr britz that britz marketing would have to give serious consideration to sourcing surf mats from a different and cheaper source than midamarine if dmc products continued to be sold s at 41 his honour reached this conclusionary observation the strength of the applicants case of deliberate copying by the first respondent favours the grant of the interlocutory injunction the impugned dmc products are clearly and objectively a deliberate copy of the wavestar the person responsible for the design and manufacturer of the dmc product knew that the product was a copy of the wavestar and knew of the claim that the design of the wavestar product was protected by a registered design in those circumstances it seems to me that dmc has embarked on a task of ordering and importing the impugned products with its eyes wide open as to the potential consequences of so doing namely that it will be exposed to the present application

1147,29,33,495,393,43512,in secretary department of family and community services v chamberlain 2002 fca 67 2002 116 fcr 348 chamberlain kiefel j addressed at some length the question of the circumstances that might be special within s 1184k in particular her honour reviewed earlier cases and noted at 32 that two of them kertland v secretary department of family and community services 1999 fca 1596 1999 95 fcr 64 and secretary department of social security v smith 1991 30 fcr 56 were unusual in that in them it could be seen objectively that there could not have been a double payment so that it might be concluded that the statutory assumption operated unjustly her honour thought that that situation would not often arise and set those cases apart from the usual 69 in chamberlain 2002 fca 67 116 fcr 348 itself the effect of the statutory formula was that the applicant would have to pay back more than twice the amount that had been allocated to loss of earnings and of earning capacity in her lump sum settlement nonetheless her honour thought that such a factor would be present in many cases and was simply an aspect of the outworking of the formula her honour considered that it could not by itself amount to special circumstances 70 like mr clark mrs chamberlain was elderly she was aged 60 years when on 13 january 1999 she suffered personal injury in a motor vehicle accident at the time she was in receipt of an age pension and she had previously received a disability support pension she claimed to have been able and entitled to earn up to 50 per week from teaching music without her pension entitlement being affected her claim was settled for 35000 plus 4000 for costs the parties to the settlement allocated 31500 to pain and suffering and medical expenses and 3500 to loss of earnings and of earning capacity 71 mrs chamberlain had continued to receive the age pension from the time of the accident at that time it was ss 1165 and 1166 of the ss act that provided for the lump sum preclusion period and refund in mrs chamberlains case and s 1184 of the ss act that provided for a discretion in the secretary to treat the whole or part of a compensation payment as not having been made or not liable to be made if the secretary should think it appropriate to do so in the special circumstances of the case under s 173a the compensation part of the lsp was 17500 the preclusion period was arrived at by dividing that sum by 42290 giving a period of 41 weeks the period ran from the date of the injury 13 january 1999 to 26 october 1999 the statutory formula produced the result that in respect of that period mrs chamberlain was liable to pay to the commonwealth 764336 more than twice the sum of 3500 mentioned above 72 kiefel j stated at 34 35 34 the basis for the tribunals view that special circumstances were established was its acceptance of what the parties to the settlement said had been offered and accepted for the economic loss component it was far less than the statute assumed to be the case in applying the formulae again however this will be so in many if not most cases to which the act applies further the extent of the difference from the basis upon which the parties acted could not provide the necessary special circumstance the statute has selected a figure which may operate in an arbitrary way 35 the statutory objectives in utilising the formulae referred to above must also be borne in mind it is not intended that a decisionmaker be required to consider contentions about what part of the compensation reflected the economic loss component that is so whether one has regard to the application of the formulae or the discretion under s 1184 the latter does not alter the objective and must be read in light of it 73 her honour set aside the tribunals decision 74 if chamberlain 2002 fca 67 116 fcr 348 is to be followed the present application must be dismissed 75 i respectfully agree with the approach that was taken by kiefel j the expression special circumstances in s 1184k does not embrace the circumstance that the 50 percent rule will yield a preclusion period beginning on a certain date that will or may be excessive even grossly excessive having regard to the component included in a lump sum settlement for loss of earnings or of earning capacity to the age of the injured person and perhaps to other circumstances 76 once one embarks on an inquiry of the kind that would be required in such a case one is defeating the legislative intention the parliament must be taken to have contemplated as usual or ordinary the circumstances of people placed as mr clark is in effect by adopting the rough and ready 50 percent rule the legislature has faced such people with a choice not sue at all and to rely instead on such other entitlements as may be available litigate to trial so that the court will identify a figure for loss of earnings and of earning capacity or settle subject to the operation of the 50 percent rule 77 in the present case mr clark must be taken to have decided against the former two courses i do not know why he did so in one sense it seems unfair that mr clark should suffer a preclusion period until 15 february 2008 but i do not think that this constitutes special circumstances in the light of the legislative intention 78 if the position were otherwise the reacutegime that was introduced in 1988 would be defeated because it would be again open to parties to a settlement to attribute an artificially low figure to loss of earnings and earning capacity and to the injured person through s 1184k of the ss act to initiate the very kind of investigation that it was the intention of the 1988 amending act to eliminate 79 for the above reasons i do not think that the aat erred in law in failing to exercise the discretion given by s 1184k of the ss act

2004,99,26,490,96,43021,at the time of the mediation the company appeared to have limited financial capacity as i have said it was uninsured its last trading price was 001 which is the lowest price that can be quoted on the asx this is a matter of considerable importance in determining whether to exercise the power i will refer later to the similar circumstances that arose in lopez v star world enterprises pty ltd 1999 fca 104 the terms of settlement provide that the parties to the agreement are the applicants in each proceeding the respondents and the group members referred to in each of the proceedings clause 2 of the agreement provides the essential terms of the settlement which are that there is to be a verdict for the respondents and the respondents are to pay to the applicants the sum of 3 million in full and final settlement of both sets of proceedings in lopez finkelstein j referred at 16 to the onerous task involved in the consideration of an application as i mentioned earlier the application in lopez has some striking similarities to the situation which arises in the present matter that is because in lopez there was a very real likelihood that if the case went to a final hearing the group members would not receive anything like the amount they will receive upon the approval of the compromise the reason for this was that the company was hopelessly insolvent and success in the proceeding would have left group members in a position where their claim would be reduced to the ability to prove in a winding up as his honour remarked at 19 that is hardly an enticing position a further similarity in lopez was that there was an insurance fund which was available his honour referred at 23 to the effect of s 562 of the then corporations law which had the effect that the approval of the settlement and the application of the insurance funds would not in any way adversely affect the interests of unsecured creditors of the company whilst village life is conceded to have limited assets what i have said about lopez is not to suggest in any way that the company is insolvent in this case as mr abadee submitted the stark consequences of the court withholding its approval to the settlement would be that any successful judgment that may be obtained by the applicants and subsequently by group members would be wiped out by the legal costs which would be incurred in pursuing the proceedings to final judgment the estimate of those costs provided in mr mouliss affidavit is in an amount of approximately 48 million mr moulis is an experienced practitioner in this field and i accept his estimate as being within the range in this type of matter it seems to me to be likely that the individual respondents who would be entitled to indemnity from the insurer would incur costs of that order in defending the proceedings accordingly if the matter were to proceed to a final hearing the entire amount of the insurance fund would be eaten up by legal fees that is of course an unfortunate consequence of the complexity of this type of proceeding nevertheless it is a fact which informs the fairness and reasonableness of the settlement which has been reached although the letter from the individual respondents solicitors suggests that two of the respondents may have some funds at present it is in my view reasonable to infer that were the matter to proceed to final judgment all of the personal respondents would have to eat into their own assets to such an extent that there would be nothing left for the applicant and group members that is to say there would be no financial return from success in the proceeding

federal commissioner of taxation 1963 hca 41 1963 113 clr 475 where in the reasons for judgment of kitto j at 5024 his honour considered whether the taxation board of review was legally bound to conform to the principles of natural justice in dealing with a reference in a case under s 136 kitto j made the prefatory observations that a legal obligation so to act arises in respect of many statutory powers there being no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry and every kind of tribunal but what the law requires in the discharge of a quasijudicial function is judicial fairness which is not a label for any fixed body of rules and what is fair in a given situation depends upon the circumstances the statutory context of the then income tax and social services contribution assessment act 19361958 cth which was of course in focus in mobil oil is significantly removed from that of the management act mr rhodes sought support additionally for the operation in principle of the rules as to natural justice from the dictum of brennan j in national companies and securities commission v news corporation ltd 1984 hca 29 1984 156 clr 296 at 326 where his honour observed as follows the limits of a statutory function are ascertained the interests which are apt to be affected by the performance of the function can be identified then it is possible for a court to say in the absence of express statutory provision what has to be done to be fair to those whose interests are apt to be affected by the performance of the function the terms of the statute which creates the function the nature of the function and the administrative framework in which the statute requires the function to be performed are material factors in determining what must be done to satisfy the requirements of natural justice those considerations render formidable the task of establishing the operation of the rules of natural justice in the present statutory context where the basis for prospective qualification would be the same for all applicants that being the holding of an existing shark permit conditional of course upon payment of the permit fee or levy

from others such as szfoh v minister for immigration and citizenship 2007 159 fcr 199 where there had been no appearance by the applicant at the tribunals hearing lee v minister for immigration and citizenship 2007 159 fcr 181 where the failure to reply to a notice of invitation to comment allowed the tribunal to proceed to make a decision without further invitation to the applicant and vean of

sent to and received by the authorised recipient because it had been addressed to the applicant care of the authorised recipient because the appellant was in fact fully heard and the tribunal rejected the veracity of his claims it is a case where the decisionmaker was bound by the governing statute to refuse the application szbyr v minister for immigration and citizenship 2007 235 alr 609 at 29 per gleeson cj gummow callinan heydon and crennan jj and separately kirby j and hayne j 25 however the decision in szbyr 235 alr 609 was given on 13 june 2007 shortly after the decisions in lee 159 fcr 181 and szfoh 159 fcr 199 and in my opinion szbyr 235 alr 609 now provides authoritative guidance as succinctly put by counsel for the minister the appellants in szbyr 235 alr 609 argued that the tribunal had failed to comply with s 424a of the act in dealing with issue a but the tribunal had also relied on issue b which was in itself an independent ground for refusing their application at 29 gleeson cj gummow callinan heydon and crennan jj said the present is a case in which no useful result could ensue from the grant of the relief desired by the appellants this is so because even if the appellants be correct as to the proper operation of s 424a they cannot overcome the tribunals finding that their claims lacked the requisite convention nexus the appellants case like mobile oil canada limited cited in re refugee tribunal ex parte aala 2000 2000 hca 57 204 clr 82 at 56 was one in which irrespective of any question of procedural fairness or individual merits the decisionmaker was bound by the governing statute to refuse footnotes omitted hayne j likewise said at 91 the refugee review tribunals finding that the appellants claims lacked the requisite nexus with the convention was inevitable that being so the appellants were not entitled to relief of the kind they sought the discretion to grant that relief was to be exercised against them footnotes omitted 26 kirby j agreed that relief should be refused on discretionary grounds but on a narrower basis his honour took the view that issue b as counsel and i have called it the nexus issue in szbyr 235 alr 609 was on analysis the only reason for the tribunals decision and was sufficient however his honour said at 8789 once the foregoing conclusion became clear it was immaterial to examine the extent of the default of the tribunal if any under section 424a any such default could not have affected the decision of the tribunal for the reason that it accepted an application for judicial review of that decision was therefore liable to dismissal on discretionary grounds discretionary refusal of judicial review must be exercised with care particularly where the hypothesis of jurisdictional error is a possibility however in some such cases of which this was one invocation of the discretion is proper prudent economical and just in effect the discretion allows the reviewing court to say the case is clear a sound basis for the challenged decision has been established even if a postulated error has occurred in complying with s424a and could be proved any such error is immaterial because it could not undermine the essential legal basis that sustains the decision in that event to divert the courts time and resources into examining a supposed technical breach is not a proper use of its energies nor is it required by the justice of the case when such conclusions are reached the reviewing court is entitled to and should reject the application in the exercise of its discretion it should leave analysis of suggested technical infractions to a case where the result of such analysis might influence the outcome this was not such a case footnotes omitted 27 in my opinion those pungent observations of kirby j are entirely applicable by way of analogy here 28 factors relevant to the exercise of discretion in this case are it seems to me first the tribunals default was patently one of a mere clerical oversight rather than a studied misapplication of the law second this is not a case where simply actual notice had also come to the attention of the appellant personally in his application before the tribunal but there was no notice to any person authorised by him to be his desired recipient third there was in fact notification to someone in whose understanding of the legal and practical implications of his litigious position the appellant had confidence fourth here the appellant acted on that actual notice and in the event there was secured to him every right and opportunity of substance which s 441g envisaged for him there was adequate and due notice of the hearing and an unmistakably clear and adequate opportunity to attend before the tribunal and for him to put his case to it all of which opportunities the appellant took up 30 if my decision should not be in accord with lee 159 fcr 181 and szfoh 159 fcr 199 i believe any departure of mine from the reasoning in those cases is appropriate and warranted after szbyr 235 alr 609 i should add however that all the cases on exercise of discretion have to be closely examined in the light of their own facts it is very easy to make remarks able to be read as nostrums for general application when really what the court is doing is seeking to explain the considerations which have weighed with it in the instant case i have probably been guilty of the same thing here myself i do not suggest that i would necessarily have decided lee 159 fcr 181 or szfoh 159 fcr 199 differently even after szbyr 235 alr 609 their facts are not these facts

22047,15,14,96,33,44647,full court of this court in carnell v mann 1998 89 fcr 247 at 254 held that pursuant to ss 118 and 119 originals and copies are equally protected subject to the privilege being lost for one of the reasons set out in the succeeding sections of the act the second email was merely an electronic means of delivering a copy of the first email to mr anderson alternative means could have been employed by ep a photocopy of the first email could have been sent by mail or hand delivered or sent by facsimile transmission each method is to the same effect a copy of the original privileged communication would have been delivered to mr anderson the language of s 118a is directed to prohibiting evidence being adduced that would result in disclosure of a confidential communication made between a client and a lawyer to allow for example crossexamination of mr drummond by senior counsel for euroz utilising the second email would inevitably result in evidence being adduced which would result in the disclosure in whole or part of the privileged communication in the first email this reflects the position at common law as noted by the full court in carnell v mann at 254 when their honours observed in principle whether copies of original documents are privileged at common law should be determined by asking what was the purpose underlying the creation of those original documents and not what was the purpose underlying the creation of the copies see carlton cranes ltd v consolidated hotels ltd 1988 2 nzlr 555 at 557 per tompkins j the better view we think is that at common law the mere act of copying a privileged document does not lead to loss of privilege in the copy simply because it was not created for a privileged purpose in an era where so many documents are routinely copied it would be peculiar to think that the existence of legal professional privilege in any given copy might depend upon the purpose underlying the making of that specific copy emphasis added it cannot be said that there was an express obligation however the circumstances in my opinion give rise to an implied obligation upon mr anderson viewed objectively not to disclose the contents of the first email contained in the second email it may be seen that such an obligation need not be one which arises under law by virtue of s 1171 as the court said in carnell v mann at 259 the parliament must have had in mind relationships broader than those of for example solicitorclient when it enacted the definitions of confidential communication and confidential document in s 1171 the very content of the first email which was copied in the second email disclosed on its face so far as mr drummond objectively might have considered that it related to legal proceedings actual or anticipated involving ep mr bruce drummond as one of its directors and inferentially mr graham anderson as a potential witness or at least someone who might be in a position to assist in various ways with that litigation again selfevidently the first email was addressed to at least one person at slater amp gordon a wellknown australian legal firm it included information concerning the private financial affairs of ep furthermore the second email in the section directed to mr anderson shows the subject as fw addition to witness statement accordingly it was being sent and must be taken to have been received in the context of at least anticipated litigation in my opinion it is inconceivable that ep and mr anderson would have considered the communication of the second email to be other than on a strictly confidential basis furthermore i am satisfied that the relationship between ep and mr anderson was of a confidential nature in addition to the other matters which i have mentioned such is the case generally as between a client and the clients accountant i do not mention these matters with a view to attributing any particular purpose but rather to characterise the confidential nature of the communication this is not to say that the purpose of the communication may not be relevant to the question whether it was a confidential communication but merely that it is neither necessary to nor determinative of the resolution of the question

at the time of the decision and not those that followed it freeman v secretary department of social security 1988 19 fcr 342 hospital benefit fund of wa v minister for health housing and community

513 and aged care standards and accreditation agency ltd v kenna investments pty ltd 2004 fca 843 2004 138 fcr 428 the respondent submitted that the clear line of authority referred to by the authority beginning with the decision of davies j in freeman in support of the submission that the correct point in time is the time of the decision under review is not directly relevant to the present question and can be distinguished because those authorities relate to different legislative provisions the respondent analysed the reasoning of the court in freeman that case it was said is commonly cited as authority for the proposition that the relevant point in time at which the tribunal is to determine a persons entitlement will differ depending upon whether the decision under review was a decision refusing to grant an entitlement or whether it was one cancelling an existing entitlement where the decision is to refuse an entitlement the point in time is the date of the tribunals decision and where the decision is to cancel an entitlement the tribunal is limited to considering the state of affairs as it existed on the date of the decision under review the respondent submitted that critical to the courts reasoning in freeman was that in that case the tribunal had affirmed the decision under review to cancel the applicants pension this meant that no further matter remained for the tribunals consideration at 345 and any entitlement of the applicant for a further pension would only revive when a fresh application for a pension had been made at 345 346 the respondent submitted that freeman should not be taken as authority for any general principle that administrative decisions may be categorized either as cancellation decisions or refusal decisions to which vastly different regimes of review are applicable if it does then it was respectfully submitted that it was wrong and should not be followed it was submitted that any attempt to apply such a universal categorisation to cancellations and refusals merely distracts from the primary question which is to identify the issues required under the particular legislation the question here according to the respondent should therefore focus on whether s 3031f itself fixes a point in time the respondent submitted that there is nothing in s 3031f of the act to suggest that the point in time for the determination of the fitness and integrity issue is to be limited to the date of the authoritys decision and that the tribunal is not entitled to take account of developments which have occurred up until the date of the tribunals decision the respondent said indeed a consideration of the provision suggests that the point in time should be the situation as it has developed by the time of the tribunals decision the respondent pointed out that the present case was of course factually different from freeman in that here the tribunal set aside the authoritys decision to cancel the respondents registration and substituted it with a decision to caution the respondent subject to conditions whereas in freeman the tribunal had affirmed the decision to cancel the applicants pension so that no further matter remained for the tribunals consideration in freeman therefore any entitlement of the applicant for a further pension would revive only when a fresh application for a pension had been made here the decision had been set aside ab initio so that the parties were placed in the position that they would have occupied had the decision never been made so that the respondent had the benefit of the extant decision granting him registration see secretary department of social security v oconnell 1992 38 fcr 540 549 550 the tribunal therefore remained a part of the continuum of the administrative decisionmaking process and there was no impediment to it determining what were the appropriate orders to be made as at the date of the tribunals decision the respondent submitted that the only specific complaint made by the authority as to irrelevant evidence taken into account by the tribunal related to the respondents current practice and his current success rate when considered in the context of all the evidence before the tribunal both of these pieces of evidence were relevant either because they related to events that occurred before the cancellation decision or they were afteracquired evidence the respondent submitted that on any view of s 3031f the tribunal was therefore entitled to take account of the evidence referred to as the respondents current practice and his current success rate in relation to the cancellation decision in addition the respondent submitted that whether or not the tribunal was entitled to take the afteracquired evidence into account in relation to the cancellation decision it was undoubtedly required to take it into account in relation to the suspension decision and the two refusal decisions on the authoritys case and the authority of freeman the point in time for those decisions would have been the date of the tribunals decision given that the tribunal gave a joint decision on all four decisions under review it was not possible for the authority to establish with any degree of probability that the evidence of the respondents current practice and his current success rate was necessarily taken into account in relation to the cancellation decision the respondent noted that at no time during the tribunals hearing did the authority object to the reception of the evidence relating to respondents current practice and his current success rate it was put that this may be relevant to the issue of costs should the authority succeed in this appeal the authority submitted that in freeman the issue for determination by the tribunal was whether the decision to cancel on the date of the original cancellation was the correct or preferable decision not whether the applicant was entitled to a benefit at the time of the tribunals decision the authority submitted that that is the same in this case the question for the tribunal was whether its cancellation decision in july 2003 was the correct or preferable decision not whether the respondent might be eligible to be registered in september 2005 in freeman davies j indicated that it is important to have regard to the nature of the decision the distinction his honour saw as critical was between a decision to refuse to grant a pension or benefit where there was an ongoing entitlement which can be seen as part of a continuum and a decision to cancel a pension made on a particular date a decision of this kind has no ongoing nature once made it is spent davies j noted that under the social security act 1947 cth once a benefit is cancelled it may only be paid again following a fresh application that is also the position in the present legislative context where a migration agent has had his registration cancelled he would need to apply for registration afresh and cannot make such an application for five years s 292 in this sense the present case is even stronger than that considered by davies j in freeman davies j noted that a further distinction between entitlement decisions and cancellation decisions is that in the former case but not the latter the tribunal can decide entitlement throughout the relevant continuum up to its decision this is not possible in cancellation cases because if the cancellation decision was correct or preferable there is no further step that is also the position here and probably in all cancellation cases the authority noted that the respondent had sought to distinguish this case on the basis that the legislation is different however the authority argued no material difference was identified the only difference is the one noted above and it tends to show that this case is even more clear cut than that in freeman it was also observed that the power to cancel pensions in the social security act was not restricted to being exercised at some point in time this it was said was not part of davies js analysis contrary to the respondents submissions the authority noted that the full court in hospital benefit fund of wa v minister for health housing and community affairs approved the analysis of davies j in freeman at 2345 in that case the legislation tied the primary decisionmaker to a small period of time after certain rule changes were notified the court found that the tribunal faced the same question as the primary decisionmaker which required it to look at the time the original decision should have been made the legislation in that case is different from that in the present however the authority submitted the core principle is that the tribunal must answer the same question as was answered by the primary decisionmaker for the reasons given by davies j in freeman in a cancellation case that involves whether the decision to cancel on the actual date of the cancellation was the correct or preferable decision the authority observed that this analysis was also endorsed and applied by weinberg j in sharma at 524 526 61 63 and in the context of review of a decision to cancel a visa under the act by katz j in nong albeit through reference to weinberg j in sharma who applied freeman at 29 31 29 as i understood the submission at least in the form in which it appeared in mr nongs written outline of submissions filed in advance of the hearing before me it was that the mrt had erred in not concluding that on 6 january 2000 the date of its decision mr nong was in compliance with condition 8202 30 that submission may be dealt with quite briefly 31 the mrt was not concerned in making its decision with the issue whether mr nong was or was not in compliance with condition 8202 on 6 january 2000 the date of its own decision rather it was concerned with the issue whether mr nong had or had not been in compliance with condition 8202 on 30 march 1999 the date of the delegates decision see for example the discussion of the nature of the review function of the mrts predecessor in minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v sharma 1999 fca 31 1999 90 fcr 513 at 524526 61 63 weinberg j emphasis added the authority observed that in aged care standards and accreditation agency branson j considered that only limited assistance was gained from categorising decisions as cancellation decisions or entitlements decisions at 26 her honour considered that it was necessary to consider the nature of the decision involved in that case the tribunal was to review a decision to vary the period of accreditation for an aged care provider this decision did not fit readily into the cancellation entitlement dichotomy her honour considered that in the legislation before her the fact that a decision could be made only after an audit report was obtained and only within 14 days of receipt of that report was important however her honour also applied the reasoning of davies j in freeman in concluding that the decision was not part of an administrative continuum her honour also observed at 30 31 30 in my view the tribunal would be undertaking a quite different process from that which the principles required the accreditation body to undertake were it to review a decision made under s 324 by reference to factual material remote in time from the review audit report in particular i consider that on review of a decision made under s 324 it is not open to the approved provider to seek to undermine the significance of the review audit report and the recommendations included in it by calling evidence of improvements in its practice and procedure implemented after the date of the decision and in response to the review audit report and recommendations 31 i conclude that the tribunal would not be addressing the same questions as the applicant was required to address if it were to determine whether at the time of the tribunals decision the decision of the applicant under s 324 of the principles can be seen to be the correct or preferable decision this is not to say that the tribunal cannot receive evidence of facts that occurred after the date of the decision under review however to be relevant to the tribunals decision that evidence must in my view bear on the merits of the decision as at the time that it was required to be made in summary the authority submitted by way of reply that 1 applying the principles stated in freeman the review of a decision to cancel a migration agents registration on a particular date involves a determination of whether that decision was the correct or preferable decision at that date 2 where a decision is made to cancel say because an agent does not have the necessary ambit of knowledge of migration procedures at the time of the decision as shown by a track record of failings in this regard a review applicant cannot show that that was not the correct or preferable decision by acquiring the relevant knowledge thereafter if the person has become eligible he or she may then be able to apply for registration afresh 3 similarly where a decision is made to cancel because of massive and serious violations of the code of conduct it would be absurd if a review applicant could seek to rely upon compliance with the code after the date of the decision compliance achieved by enforcement proceedings is not what the legislation is designed to achieve agents are required to comply with the legislation when registered 4 for these reasons and the reasons outlined above this court should follow freeman and the cases that have applied it and conclude that the question before the tribunal in relation to the cancellation decision was whether the decision to cancel on 14 july 2003 was the correct or preferable decision having regard to the circumstances pertaining up to that time 5 the respondent argued that it would be against the policy of the act if the tribunal were not permitted to have regard to events following the cancellation decision he suggests there is no reason why the tribunal should not find that it has become satisfied of s 3031e if an agent becomes bankrupt during the review processes the authority says that this reasoning is flawed and not necessary a later bankruptcy does not indicate that any earlier decision to cancel because of lack of integrity was the correct or preferable decision it is irrelevant to that question or without more would be the authority could of course cancel the registration afresh on the basis of the bankruptcy when it becomes aware that that has happened a person whose registration was wrongfully cancelled should not have it affirmed simply because a reason to cancel it subsequently arises there is also a fresh power to cancel when a proper reason arises likewise a person whose cancellation was correct or preferable should not be able to avoid that proper consequence because of actions taken after the decision to rectify perceived deficiencies 6 contrary to the respondents submission no part of the authoritys argument requires the notion of fitness or character to be narrowly construed however success rates in late 2003 and 2004 simply have no bearing on the respondents fitness before that time nor does any absence of subsequent breaches of the code 7 it may be accepted that evidence of character after the date of the decision could be relevant because character has been held to involve the enduring moral qualities of a person so for example evidence that a person has lied or not been frank in their evidence after the date of the decision would be relevant not directly as breaches of a rule requiring honesty but as an indicia of a persons enduring moral qualities an inference would be available that an adult prepared to lie to or mislead the tribunal or just not be frank at its hearing had the same moral qualities at the time of the decision however this reasoning does not mean that evidence relating to every criteria post the cancellation decision is relevant for example evidence that an agent has knowledge in 2004 simply does not show that he had that knowledge in 2003 8 the respondents reliance upon pekowallsend is misconceived the authority does not say that the tribunal may not have regard to the most up to date evidence at hand however it has to be evidence that is relevant to the question at hand the position in july 2003 9 contrary to the respondents submission the absence of a time limit for the making of a decision to cancel does not have the result that the tribunal is required to make its decision on the basis of all evidence up to the time of its decision freeman nong 10 the respondent seeks to get some assistance from extrinsic materials it is said that his construction is consistent with the object stated in the passage quoted however without conceding that this is a proper use of extrinsic materials it may be answered by noting that the authoritys construction is also consistent with that object 11 contrary to the respondents submission it would not be inimical to the achievement of the objects of the provisions if the tribunal could not have regard to adverse developments that happened after the making of the decision under review the authority would be having regard to such conduct and is ideally placed to take appropriate action even if a review is pending in relation to an earlier decision indeed this happened in this very case when the respondents registration was suspended while the cancellation review was pending 12 it would however be inimical to the achievement of the objects if agents who have been cancelled for failing to comply with the code of conduct or failing to maintain necessary knowledge can avoid that legislated consequence by relying upon subsequent improved conduct and subsequent compliance a system of this kind is less likely to be effective in ensuring that agents comply at all times if there is a perception that the consequences of breaches can be avoided 13 the respondents submissions at 34 supra misconceive davies js reasons in freeman they did not turn upon the fact that the tribunal had affirmed the cancellation decision but upon the nature of the decision under review the respondents argument is some kind of bootstraps argument the tribunals decision is being challenged because it failed to appreciate the nature of its task that task does not have a different nature according to the conclusion it reaches at the end of the task 14 the respondent submitted that all the evidence relied upon by the tribunal in addressing the question it answered as at september 2005 would have been available if it had asked itself the correct question as at july 2003 this is said to support a futility argument this court should not accept the proposition that the tribunals error it is implicitly admitted by the respondent that it did answer the question as at september 2005 and on the authoritys submissions as to law this would be an error of law could not have made a difference 15 first some of the evidence was not relevant to 14 july 2003 a is this form of file note taking does this represent approximately what your current practice would be with taking files notes yes ab 550 b is that representative of your current practice in relation to client agreements ab 551 c mr shi do you now keep copies or is it your practice to keep copies of letters on file to your clients yes yes ab 5553 d the evidence of his success rate from the beginning of 2003 until august 2004 presented in a form that did not disclose that rate as at july 2003 ab 566 567 575 576 803 775 776 16 in any event even if the evidence were all relevant it may have been weighted differently if the correct question were asked the court should remit the matter to the tribunal if it finds that the tribunal misunderstood its task 17 as the tribunal dealt with all four review decisions together the court cannot be sure that the tribunal did not have regard to the later evidence only in relation to the decisions of later dates the point is however that the tribunal dealt with them all together when it needed to separate the decision according to their nature and the evidence that was relevant to each the fact that it did not do this proves the authoritys case rather than the reverse after having considered the relevant provisions of the act the authorities to which i was referred and the respective submissions of the parties i have concluded that the clear line of authority beginning with the decision of davies j in freeman upon which the authority relies does govern the position in relation to the cancellation decision and that the question which the tribunal had to ask itself was whether on 14 july 2003 the correct or preferable decision was to cancel the respondents registration in other words the question which the tribunal had to ask itself was whether as at that date the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance i am of the view that the tribunal did not ask itself this question rather it asked itself whether at the time of its decision the respondent was not a person of integrity or was otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance i am impelled to the view that the tribunal asked itself the wrong question by reference to the tribunals 2 september 2005 reasons in particular at 14 15 17 and 24 see the

principle applies to require primus proceeding in this court to be dismissed without adjudication of its merits 4 before embarking on an examination of the relevant facts which are said to give rise to the operation of the anshun principle it is important to bear in mind the parameters of the principle guided by anshun itself and subsequent judgments of the full court of this court and various state courts of appeal i now turn to those matters i do so mindful of the fact that whether the principle applies depends on the particular circumstances involved see egglishaw v australian crime commission 2007 164 clr 224 and gibbs v kinna 1999 2 vr 19 at 23 per kenny ja with whom phillips ja agreed 5 the invocation of the anshun principle is a serious step and a power which should not be exercised without a scrupulous examination of all the circumstances it is to be applied only in the clearest of cases as it ends a litigants right to have the merits of a claim adjudicated and may result in a serious injustice if applied too readily to do otherwise would be to hamper free access to the courts without careful consideration of the consequences see ling v commonwealth 1996 fca 1646 1996 68 fcr 180 at 182 per wilcox j and gibbs v kinna at 33 6 no estoppel arises unless the new claim relied on was so relevant to the subject matter of the first proceeding that it would have been unreasonable not to rely on it in that proceeding anshun at 602603 however the concept of relevance is more helpful when considering the failure to raise a defence than a failure to advance a claim see gibbs v kinna at 24 and egglishaw at 28 further the mere fact that each proceeding is closely related is an insufficient basis to invoke the principle given that it is concerned with substance and not form and technicalities bazos v doman 2001 nswca 347 at 44 per stein ja with whom priestly ja and beazley ja agreed 7 other than in special circumstances the principle applies if it was unreasonable for a claimant to have refrained from raising the new claim in the earlier proceeding anshun at 602 egglishaw at 21 the issue is not whether it would have been reasonable to advance the claim beforehand because it was possible to do so but whether it was unreasonable to defer reliance egglishaw at 24 and 34 and gibbs v kinna per ormiston ja at 2 8 in considering the issue of unreasonableness it is first necessary to determine whether the subject matter of the subsequent claim could have been raised in the earlier proceeding anshun at 598 gibbs v kinna at 23 and wong v minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs no 2 2004 fca 422 2004 146 fcr 1 at 37 per lindgren j next to invoke the principle it must be shown that the same or substantially the same facts will arise for consideration in the new proceeding as arose in the earlier proceeding gibbs v kinna at 23 these two factors were described by kenny ja in gibbs v kinna at 23 as necessary but not sufficient considerations for the application of the principle 9 another factor indicative of unreasonableness is whether any judgment or order made in the later proceeding would conflict with any judgment or order made in the earlier proceeding anshun at 604 gibbs v kinna at 25 and egglishaw at 32 putting to one side this factor and the two factors examined in the preceding paragraphs there still remains a question whether the failure to raise the claim in the earlier proceeding was unreasonable egglishaw at 37 25 the claims raised in the current proceeding were relevant to the subject of the earlier proceeding given that the same parties were agitating issues concerning the breakdown of their commercial relationship however the fact that the new south wales litigation and this proceeding are closely related is insufficient to invoke the anshun principle the question remains whether it was unreasonable for primus to defer reliance on its current claims 26 based in large part on the inadequacy of the response of primus solicitor when asked why he did not raise the current issues earlier the subject matter of the current claims could have been raised in the new south wales supreme court at first instance this may have been done by way of an amendment to that proceeding with the original new south wales claims raised in addition or in the alternative 30 the alleged unreasonableness is not manifest no doubt it would have been more convenient for the issues raised in the current proceeding to have been advanced in new south wales but that is not the question it is not appropriate when considering the anshun principle to say what a party could reasonably have done the proper question is was it unreasonable to do as that party did in any event there is much force in the view expressed by wheeler ja in custombuilt homes that one should exercise considerable caution in summarily dismissing an application before the issues are crystalised after the filing of a defence to this one might add andor contentions of fact and law a judgment dismissing the matter before the court is interlocutory in nature it would still be open to kooee to advance its submissions based on the anshun principle at the trial of the proceeding when the issues will be more clearly defined 31 this is not a clear case for the invocation of the anshun principle the critical facts will differ substantially from the essential facts which were relevant in new south wales where the separation deed was the main focus of the courts analysis as distinct from the conduct of kooee over a confined period there is no risk of inconsistent judgments or orders it was not unreasonable for primus to refrain from advancing its current claims before the supreme court of new south wales

3298,45,10,417,248,30237,morning the parties were in agreement that the conclusion by the tribunal that the disciplinary process commenced on 30 may 2002 was in error because of this courts decision in comcare v eames 2008 101 ald 90 in eames madgwick j concluded that the tribunal had erred in law by considering that the disciplinary process did not include the investigation process giving rise to it the application of eames to the present case leads to the conclusion that the tribunal erred in concluding that the disciplinary process did not begin until mr caldwell received the formal letter on 30 may 2002 eames was decided on 1 april 2002 the last day of the hearing of this matter in the tribunal took place on 4 april 2002 the evidence as to what was actually submitted to the tribunal on that day is not entirely clear what is clear though is that the tribunal was aware of eames so much appears from paragraph 67 of its reasons for judgment which makes explicit reference to it it is then necessary to deal with the application for leave to amend the grant of leave was formally opposed ordinarily on such an application there would be two relevant matters first it would be necessary to ask whether the proposed amendment is one which has reasonable prospects of success secondly it is to be asked whether the granting of the amendment would or might cause irremediable prejudice to the other party here in light of eames there can be no question that the proposed amendment is arguable that of course is reinforced by the fact that the proposed amendment has already appeared in the proceeding in the notice of contention filed by the respondent returning to the question of prejudice the parties are in agreement that if the amendment is allowed then in one shape or another the proceeding will have to be remitted to the tribunal they are in disagreement as to what the nature of any rehearing before the tribunal should be the appellant argues that the matter should be remitted to the tribunal differently constituted during argument it became apparent that the basis for that argument was a suggestion that there would otherwise arise a reasonable apprehension of bias by way of prejudgment on the other hand the respondent submitted that all that needed to be done was for the tribunal now to tailor its reasons for judgment with more care it is difficult to be precisely sure how the hearing before the tribunal will proceed it may be that there is force in the submission that what has already taken place before the tribunal and what appears in its reasons for judgment may bespeak a reasonable apprehension of bias by way of prejudgment however i explicitly make no finding about that matter a proper consideration of that submission would of course require not only an analysis of the reasons of the tribunal but also of the transcript and of the various submissions which were made to it one further matter which is relevant to the exercise of the discretion to grant leave to amend and which was particularly pressed by mr caldwell is the position of the appellant in these proceedings the appellant was the successful party in eames the point was made by mr whybrow who appeared for mr caldwell that at the very time that comcare was in this proceeding seeking to argue that the disciplinary action commenced with the formal letter of 30 may 2002 it had already argued before this court in eames that disciplinary action could include the investigation leading to that disciplinary action mr caldwell had therefore been caused prejudice by comcares inconsistent positions a matter said to justify a refusal to grant leave if there were no identity of the parties at all this would obviously be irrelevant there may be some force in the proposition that generally speaking it is undesirable for emanations of the executive to adopt inconsistent positions in civil litigation however not enough is known of the facts surrounding how the various positions in the two cases came to be adopted i do not think in those circumstances it can be said that the unreasonableness of that is such that leave should not be granted in those circumstances i am prepared to grant comcares application to amend its notice of appeal to raise the proposed ground 23 one then needs to turn to the disposition of this mornings proceedings it is convenient first to deal with ground 23 of the amended notice of appeal ground 23 is as follows whether the tribunal erred in law by finding that the disciplinary action taken against mr caldwell did not commence until 30 may 2002 setting aside a determination of the tribunal by consent and remitting it to be determined according to law can be unhelpful if this court does not provide reasons itself in such cases the tribunal is left with no guidance as to what it is that according to law means for that reason i propose to say a few words in relation to the eames ground the tribunal said at 5557 55 during the period mr caldwell was on sick leave recovering from the effects of the flashover he was advised by mr maher that he had arranged a number of meetings for mr caldwell to attend mr caldwell was informed that one of these meetings was with the switching review committee by reason of his illhealth mr caldwell was unable to attend this meeting 56 mr caldwell did attend a meeting with mr maher and mr winchester on 18 april 2002 when they interviewed him as to the circumstances in which he was injured also at this meeting mr maher requested mr caldwell to provide a written statement for consideration by the switching review committee the following day 57 on or shortly after 20 april 2002 mr caldwell received a copy of a report by the committee this report erroneously stated that mr caldwell was not wearing the correct gloves at the time of the incident at 59 the tribunal said 59 on 2 may 2002 mr caldwell provided mr maher with a handwritten statement and a response to the report on 13 may 2002 the switching review committee issued an amended report in which it deleted the reference to mr caldwell not wearing protective gloves at the time of the incident there was also a change as to the circumstances of mr caldwells not having attended a meeting of the committee otherwise the report was the same as had been previously issued on 30 may 2002 mr caldwell received the letter from his employer advising him of the action to be taken against him in light of eames these steps were aspects of the disciplinary action which occurred prior to 30 may 2002 it follows from that that the tribunals determination that the disciplinary process commenced on the 30 may 2002 is incorrect and on that ground at least the appeal must be allowed as madgwick j held in eames this is a question of law in comcares appeal there were two other sets of grounds one related to the adequacy of the tribunals reasons insofar as it dealt with the interrelation between the medical evidence and the question of disciplinary action the other was a question of unreasonableness in fact finding both of those debates are moot in light of a conclusion that the decision needs to be set aside because of the disciplinary action determination in those circumstances the appropriate orders are that the appeal be allowed that the orders of the tribunal formally entered on 30 may 2008 be set aside that the matter be remitted to the tribunal as originally constituted and that the procedure to be adopted by the tribunal is for it to determine i should say in relation to that that there are procedural questions as to how the issue of the disciplinary action in the matter is now to be determined this may require close consideration of the evidence which has already been led these are matters for the tribunal to determine it is also for the tribunal to determine any application made by comcare for disqualification on the basis of prejudgment i now turn to the question of costs the eames point was raised in the respondents notice of contention on 17 july 2008 in my opinion the appellant should have detected the eames problem at that time or shortly thereafter that time but certainly before last friday it follows from that that between 17 july 2008 and very recently the parties have been engaged in litigation which would not have occurred if comcare had fully appreciated the significance of the notice of contention on the other hand todays hearing would have undoubtedly taken place once the eames point was discerned in those circumstances it is appropriate to order that each party pay their own costs prior to 17 july 2008 from 17 july 2008 to 14 december 2008 the appellant is to pay the respondents costs in relation to the costs of today each party is to pay their own i have considered whether to impose a costs condition on the grant of leave to appeal of the kind explored during argument but i have concluded that that is inappropriate the reasons for that are first what exactly is going to happen in the tribunal is presently unclear it may disqualify itself it may conduct a hearing at which only submissions are made it may conduct a hearing at which further evidence is taken it is not possible in that circumstance to fashion an appropriate costs order which would be fair secondly the orders of the tribunal of 24 april 2008 entered 30 may 2008 having been set aside the costs of those first proceedings are now undetermined one of the issues which the tribunal will have before it on the second hearing is the question of the costs of its first proceedings the tribunal will be better placed than i am to deal with that issue it is for those reasons i do not impose a costs requirement as a condition of the grant of leave i certify that the preceding twentyfour 24 numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the reasons for judgment herein of the honourable justice perram associate dated 27

15365,80,12,17,11,23917,next in relation to this ground the applicant appears to advance a contention that having regard to the provisions of s 201 the use of s 501 is for an improper use or an act of bad faith the applicant says that by slavishly following policy and applying s 501 in matters where s 201 could apply there has been an error in so far as discretionary power has been exercised in accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the applicants case and without availing the applicant of a process by which he could convince the decisionmaker to consider his matter under s 201 i consider that this argument is precluded by the decision of the high court in minister for immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs v nystrom 2006 hca 50 2006 230 alr 370 see also evans v minister 2006 fcafc 180
2140,53,5,491,206,37356,a court should not engage upon a determination of the merits of the case where the only outstanding claim is as to costs see re minister for immigration and ethnic affairs ex parte lai qin 1997 hca 6 1997 186 clr 622 and onetel ltd v commissioner of taxation 2000 fca 270 2000 101 fcr 548 at 552553 those cases also demonstrate that a court may inquire as to the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties to ascertain whether or not orders for costs should be made those cases would have no point if it were open to a party to ask the court to make a judgment in the very general form suggested by counsel that in the present actions against giant marine the adsteam payments have disposed of all issues other than costs appears from the decision of the high court in baxter v obacelo pty ltd 2001 hca 66 2001 205 clr 635 per gleeson cj and callinan j at 38 39 40 43 46 and 47 and per gummow and hayne jj at 55 and 56 in particular it should be noted that gummow and hayne jj approved the statement of general principle contained in the passage cited at 56 from the judgment of auld lj in jameson v central electricity generating board 1998 qb 323 that general principle is where accord and satisfaction cannot be relied upon as where a claimant settles with only one of two concurrent tortfeasors the tortfeasor facing a claim will nevertheless have a defence if the plaintiffs settlement with the other has fully compensated him for the separate wrongs done to him 18 finally the plaintiffs seek to distinguish lai qin and onetel upon the basis that they presently ask for summary judgment or judgment on admissions and not a trial i see no merit in that argument in preparing for such an application costs will be incurred by both sides in some cases those costs may be relatively insignificant in others they may be substantial the policy considerations supporting the decisions to which i have referred are as relevant to these applications as they are to trials 20 the plaintiffs submit that if they are not entitled to summary judgment they are nonetheless entitled in claiming costs to seek to demonstrate that they would probably have won had the actions gone to judgment they rely on the same matters as they rely upon in connection with the summary judgment application plus some aspects of the evidence filed in anticipation of a trial their position seems to be that giant marine ought to have responded to that evidence and that its failure to do so demonstrates that their evidence ought to be accepted there is an incongruity between such an approach and the decisions in lai qin and onetel to which i have previously referred if the parties are to call and crossexamine witnesses then the process starts to look very much like a trial on the merits for the sole purpose of deciding questions of costs the plaintiffs approach also ignores the possibility that even in the absence of contrary evidence their evidence may have been discredited in crossexamination 21 in lai qin supra mchugh j said in an appropriate case a court will make an order for costs even when there has been no hearing on the merits and the moving party no longer wishes to proceed with the action the court cannot try a hypothetical action between the parties to do so would burden the parties with the costs of a litigated action which by settlement or extracurial action they had avoided in some cases however the court may be able to conclude that one of the parties has acted so unreasonably that the other party should obtain the cost of the action in administrative law matters for example it may appear that the defendant has acted unreasonably in exercising or refusing to exercise a power and that the plaintiff had no reasonable alternative but to commence the litigation moreover in some cases a judge may feel confident that although both parties have acted reasonably one party was almost certain to have succeeded if the matter had been fully tried this is perhaps the best explanation of the unreported decision of pincus j in south east queensland electricity board v australian telecommunications commission where his honour ordered the respondent to pay 80 per cent of the applicants fixed costs even though his honour found that both parties had acted reasonably in respect of the litigation but such cases are likely to be rare if it appears that both parties have acted reasonably in commencing and defending the proceedings and the conduct of the parties continued to be reasonable until the litigation was settled or its further prosecution became futile the proper exercise of the costs discretion will usually mean that the court will make no order as to the cost of the proceeding this approach has been adopted in a large number of cases 22 mchugh j was speaking in the context of a case in which the ultimate relief sought by the applicant had been obtained without the need for continued litigation the court was fully aware of the basis upon which the matter was to be discontinued in many cases the court will be told simply that the matter has been settled without any reference to the terms of settlement in other cases the terms of settlement may say little or nothing about the relative merits of the case had it gone to trial it seems unlikely that mchugh j in referring to the likelihood of success meant to suggest that such likelihood should be assessed by detailed reference to the evidence which would have been called had the matter gone to trial such an approach would be inconsistent with the second and third sentences in the above extract mchugh j probably had in mind a settlement which occurred after a substantial part of the evidence had been heard 23 in any event even on the plaintiffs approach i am far from satisfied that they would probably have succeeded such anticipated success is said to be based upon the fact that giant marine admitted that the damage to the two vessels was ultimately caused by the failure of the discharge pipe andor the defective fender and that adsteam had failed to take reasonable care in the management of the tug by failing to detect such defects the plaintiffs assert that giant marine is liable for adsteams negligence by virtue of the standard conditions it is common ground that such conditions were part of the contract between giant marine and adsteam clauses 3 and 4 are as follows 3 whilst towing or whilst at the request express or implied of the hirer rendering any service other than towing the mater and crew of the tug or tender shall be deemed to be the servants of the hirer and under the control of the hirer andor his servants andor his agents and anyone on board the hirers vessel who may be employed andor paid by the tugowner shall likewise be deemed to be the servant of the hirer and the hirer shall accordingly be vicariously liable for any act or omission by any such person so deemed to be the servant of the hirer 4 whilst towing or whist at the request either express or implied of the hirer rendering any service of whatsoever nature other than towing a the tugowner shall not be responsible for or be liable i for damage of any description done by or to the tug or tender or done by or to the hirers vessel or done by or to any cargo or other thing on board or being loaded on board or intended to be loaded on board the hirers vessel or the tug or tender or by or to any other object or property or ii for loss of the tug or tender or the hirers vessel or of any cargo or other thing on board or being loaded on board or intended to be loaded on board the hirers vessel or the tug or tender or any other object or property or iii for any personal injury or loss of life howsoever and wheresoever caused including personal injury or loss of life of the master andor crew of andor any person on board the tug or tender or iv for any claim by a person not a party to that agreement for loss or damage of any description whatsoever arising from any cause including without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing negligence at any time of the tugowners servants or agents unseaworthiness unfitness or breakdown of the tug or tender its machinery boilers towing gear equipment lines ropes or hawsers lack of fuel stores speed or otherwise and b the hirer shall be responsible for pay for and indemnify the tugowner against and in respect of any loss or damage and any claims of whatsoever nature or howsoever arising or caused whether covered by the provisions of clause 4a hereof or not including any arising from or caused by the negligence of the tugowner or his servants or agents including the loss of or damage to the tug or tender provided that the hirer shall not be liable to the tugowner for or in respect of loss damage or claims which the hirer proves the burden of proof being on the hirer to have been solely caused by the failure of the tugowner and due to the actual fault or privity of the tugowner to make his tug or tender seaworthy for the towage or service other than towage provided however notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained the tugowner shall under no circumstances be responsible for or be liable for any loss or damage caused or contributed to by or arising out of any delay or detention of the hirers vessel or of the cargo on board or being loaded on board or intended to be loaded on board the hirers vessel or of any other object or property or of any person or any consequences thereof whether or not the same shall be caused or arise whilst towing or whilst at the request either express or implied of the hirer rendering any service of whatsoever nature other than towing or at any other time whether before during or after the making of this agreement 24 the following definitions contained in cl 1 are also relevant towing is any operation in connection with the holding pushing pulling moving escorting or guiding of the hirers vessel and the expression to tow being towed and towage shall be defined likewise the expression whilst towing shall cover the period commencing when the tug or tender is in a position to receive orders direct from the hirers vessel to commence pushing holding moving escorting or guiding the vessel or to pick up ropes or lines or when the tow rope has been passed to or by the tug or tender whichever is the sooner and ending when the final orders from the hirers vessel to cease pushing holding moving escorting or guiding the vessel or to cast off ropes or lines has been carried out or how the tow rope has been finally slipped whichever is the later and the tug or tender is safely clear of the vessel 41 i deal firstly with costs incurred prior to adsteams payments clearly the reasonableness of the parties conduct is a relevant consideration in determining the question of costs mchugh j said as much in lai qin supra the plaintiffs submit that giant marine was unreasonable in not admitting negligence unseaworthiness of the tug and damages giant marine submits that the plaintiffs were unreasonable in failing to join adsteam at an earlier stage in the proceedings these two matters are closely related giant marine also seeks to rely upon certain offers to settle made in the correspondence between the solicitors 42 at one stage i expressed surprise at adsteams absence from the proceedings at some time thereafter adsteam was joined my concern arose largely out of the fact that it seemed clear that the collision had been at least substantially caused by mechanical failure on the tug the plaintiffs assert that their failure to join adsteam at an earlier stage was the product of reasonable caution designed to avoid the incurrence of unnecessary costs given that they considered their cases against giant marine to be strong that view was based upon an unrealistic assessment of the likelihood of establishing vicarious liability in giant marine although i disagree with the view taken by the plaintiffs it was a matter of judgment in any event even if adsteam had been joined earlier it may not have paid earlier giant marines costs were incurred in defending proceedings brought against it i am unable to conclude that such costs would not have been incurred had adsteam been joined at an earlier stage 43 giant marines conduct in defending the actions must also be seen in light of the late joinder of adsteam from an early stage it was obvious that mechanical failure on the tug was the primary if not the sole cause of the plaintiffs losses it is reasonable to infer that giant marine would if held liable have looked to adsteam for contribution or indemnity subject to issues arising out of the standard conditions and any complications arising out of insurance arrangements in those circumstances giant marine could not safely make concessions as to liability or damages without reference to adsteam adsteams absence from the proceedings did not prevent giant marine from raising such matters with it but adsteam may have been reluctant to become involved further despite the plaintiffs views concerning the strengths of their respective cases giant marine had reasonable prospects of success in resisting any finding of liability in those circumstances i cannot see that it acted unreasonably in putting the plaintiffs to proof on all issues

2797,42,8,21,20,45456,his honour concluded that the spill and fill proposal for the selection of certain employees within a group for involuntary redundancy was not sufficiently proximate to any of the forms of contravening conduct contained within s 298k dismissal of all employees for a prohibited reason is squarely within s 298k notwithstanding that they represent potentially a large group dismissal of employees for a prohibited reason within a group of employees some of whom may be dismissed for a nonprohibited reason does not remove the individual or bilateral character of the prejudicial conduct on the part of the employer as against that employee it would be an odd thing if the statutory quality of contravening conduct in respect of some employees could be dissolved amongst a group and remedial entitlements otherwise available to the affected individuals thereby lost the question is whether the conduct from the standpoint of the individual notwithstanding others represents conduct carried out for a prohibited purpose it seems to me that the observations of gray j in employment advocate v williamson 2001 fca 836 2001 111 fcr 1 at 23 what is clear however is that for a contravention of s 298k to occur there must be a person or persons who fall within the description in one or more of the prohibitive reasons and at 26 it must be possible to identify some person or persons who answer the description in at least one of the prohibitive reasons in s 298l1 does not contradict the notion that an individual may fall within the description of the conduct even though such an individual forms part of a group such as that identified in the illustration by weinberg j 356 in this case the employer entities dismissed a cohort of employees some of those employees from their individual standpoint contend the dismissal was for a prohibited reason they say the circumstances that give rise to that apprehension can be seen in the attitude of mr ramsey to the amieu his hostility to the participation of the union in the workplace and the consequences of union engagement in various processes before the airc and the dissatisfaction nine of the 12 individuals were articulating about conditions of employment against the background of the steps taken by the union as to three of the individuals their concern lies in the chronology of events arising out of their constructive dismissal and the subsequent treatment of the individuals consequent upon obtaining orders from the airc and particularly orders for reinstatement 357 the dismissal of the entire cohort of employees does not provide an answer to the essential character of the contravening conduct in respect of the particular individuals the legislation provides a mechanism for an employer to demonstrate that the apprehended and thus alleged reasons for the dismissal are misplaced and incorrect by casting an onus upon the respondent to demonstrate otherwise 358 the same position obtains in relation to the conduct of refusing to employ the relevant individuals in essence the respondents say that in the case of each individual the particular person was not available for employment did not seek employment and was not denied employment moreover before a refusal to employ an individual for a prohibited reason can arise the individual must demonstrate that a vacancy was available to be filled 359 as to these matters it is clear that the individuals did seek employment enquiries were made of management staff as to the availability of the work steps were taken to refuse immediate employment by some but expressly for the purposes of trying to secure a return to work for all employees mr delaforce and mr moss formulated a compromise proposal directed to securing the return to work for all employees some individuals were episodically offered employment on a day sometimes after the event enquiries were made of management and in the immediacy of the dispute and enquiries were made at the gate as to those persons who were on the list for employment the evidence demonstrates that jobs were available and vacancies were being filled subsequent offers even though episodic demonstrate that vacancies were there to be filled notwithstanding the lengthy period of employment on the part of the 12 individuals with the south grafton abattoir from the commencement of operations by mr ramsey and the preexisting historical connection with the abattoir in the gilbertsons days none of these individuals leaving aside susan young were offered full time employment or any sustained period of casual employment
5227,79,38,230,116,40823,in my view counsel for the respondents contention cannot be accepted it is clear that the contractual intention was to provide the applicant with a termination payment of a minimum of six months regardless of whether the relationship between the parties ended by the non renewal of the term of the consultancy agreement on the expiry of the existing term or by the termination of the agreement other than for a reason set out in cl 81 during the currency of the term of the consultancy agreement this construction is consistent with the presence in the clause of the words or the term as extended or renewed is not renewed the construction contended for by the respondent is inconsistent with the presence of those words in the clause and renders those words otiose in my view it is obvious that there was a mistake by the draftsman in using the word lesser when the word greater should have been used to give effect to the obvious intention of the parties where there is an obvious mistake the court can give effect to the true contractual intention of the parties without there being any need for rectification the principle was expressed thus by santow j in the case of spunwill pty ltd v bab pty ltd 1994 36 nswlr 290 at 299 where a court can discern the intent of the parties from an examination of the document as a whole words may be supplied omitted or corrected in the instrument where it is clearly necessary in order to avoid absurdity or inconsistency fitzgerald v masters 1956 hca 53 1956 95 clr 420 at 426427 in such cases rectification of the document is not required re united pacific transport pty ltd 1968 qd r 517 codelfa construction pty ltd v state rail authority of new south wales at 346 126 in the case of fitzgerald v masters 1956 hca 53 1956 95 clr 420 the word inconsistent was read to mean consistent 127 i have found below that on the expiry of the term of the consultancy agreement on 30 june 2001 the term was not renewed i am of the view that on the nonrenewal of the consultancy agreement the applicant became entitled to a termination payment under cl 86 of the consultancy agreement it follows that in my view on the expiry of the term of the consultancy agreement on 30 june 2001 the applicant became entitled to a termination payment in a sum equal to six months fee measured by reference to the annual consultancy fee of 190 000 exclusive of gst i will hear the parties on whether a gst component is to be included in that sum as i apprehend the applicant to contend 128 the evidence of mr hayes and mr brand established that there was an agreement by conduct that the consultancy fee of 190000 per annum payable to the applicant under the consultancy agreement was from the date of the introduction of gst to be a fee that was to be free of gst in other words the applicant was entitled to earn that fee exclusive of gst and so it could add the amount of gst payable on the fee to the invoice furnished to the respondent such an agreement can also be inferred by the respondents practice in paying the invoices rendered by the applicant and other consultants after 1 july 2001 which invariably included an additional amount in respect of gst

681,7,19,235,58,42147,counsel for the department placed considerable emphasis upon the decision of french j in viskase corporation v cryovac inc 2000 fca 1695 there his honour was dealing with an application for information discovery under o 15a r 6 he said at 24 that the rule should not be permitted to authorise information discovery except for good cause shown in terms of the conditions he continued in respect of patents for inventions the exercise of the discretion must have regard both to the intrusive nature of the order and the need to encourage research and development unhampered by the prospect of speculative review of working papers by competitors to allow the remedy in this case based upon formulaic recitations of wide application would set the threshold for preaction discovery so low that there would be few cases in which a person wishing to challenge a patent could not obtain discovery of the kind which is sought here however these remarks are to be read in their context his honour expressed the view at 23 that the evidence which was required to satisfy the first element of o 15a r 6 namely reasonable cause to believe that an applicant has the right to obtain relief against the prospective respondent was an opinion expressed as a conclusion stated in terms of the rule his honour considered that the conclusionary statement was insufficient to meet the requirements of o 15a r 6a i do not think it follows that his honours observations establish that a high threshold must be satisfied before an order will be made under o 15a r 3 it is true that french j said at 24 that if an order were made in that case it would establish a very low threshold for the application of the rule but in my opinion that was because of the slender basis of the evidence in support of the reasonable cause to believe in my view the decision in viskase does not establish a gloss on the principles stated in hooper whilst good cause must be shown each case must turn on its own facts and the prospects of success are to be weighed in the balance of the interests of justice wyeths evidence as to prospects of success

20720,58,38,229,88,3720,the reasoning of the full court as gordon j noted in cadbury at 16 is persuasive and sensible and it leads to the conclusion that save where a disclosure is made for a particular and limited purpose the filing and service operates as a complete and not simply limited waiver of privilege at 1618 for the reason that the uses that may be made of the served document in the proceedings are inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect mann v carnell 1999 hca 66 1999 201 clr 1 at 29
